                    </h1>

                    World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. Users can access
                    the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and display of text and media to your device.<br
                    />
                    <br /> The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called "hypertext " or hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP. These links are electronic connections that link related pieces of information
                    so that users can access the desired information quickly. Hypertext offers the advantage to select a word or phrase from text and thus to access other pages that provide additional information related to that word or phrase.
                    <br /></a>
                    <br /> A web page is given an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A particular collection of web pages that belong to a specific URL is called a website, e.g., www.facebook.com, www.google.com, etc. So, the World
                    Wide Web is like a huge electronic book whose pages are stored on multiple servers across the world.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br /> Small websites store all of their WebPages on a single server, but big websites or organizations place their WebPages on different servers in different countries so that when users of a country search their site they could get
                    the information quickly from the nearest server.<br />
                    <br /> So, the web provides a communication platform for users to retrieve and exchange information over the internet. Unlike a book, where we move from one page to another in a sequence, on World Wide Web we follow a web of hypertext
                    links to visit a web page and from that web page to move to other web pages. You need a browser, which is installed on your computer, to access the Web.<br /><br>

                    </h1>
                    WEB SERVERS:-<br /> ------------
                    <br /> A server commonly refers to a computer program that receives and responds to requests made over a network. It receives the request for a web document from the client and sends the requested information to the client computer
                    on the Internet. A device can be both a client and a server at the same time, as an individual system has the ability to provide resources and use them from another system in one go. There are different types of servers, including
                    mail servers, virtual servers, and web servers.<br />
                    <br /> Minicomputers and mainframe computers were some of the first servers. As compared to mainframe computers, minicomputers were much smaller; therefore, they were known as the name of Minicomputers. For instance, a web server may
                    run Microsoft IIS or Apache HTTP Server, which offers users access to the information from web pages or websites over the internet. A mail server is able to run a program like iMail or Exim that provides services of SMTP (Simple Mail
                    Transfer Protocol) for sending and receiving email.<br />
                    <br /> Types of servers<br /> There are many types of servers, which are as follows:<br />
                    <br />
                    <br /> Webserver
                    <br /> Application server<br /> Blade server<br /> Cloud server<br /> Database server<br /> Dedicated server<br /> Print server<br /> Proxy server<br /> File server<br /> Mail server<br /> Standalone server<br /> Domain name service<br
                    /> Web Server<br /> A web server offers web pages or other content to the web browser by loading the information from a disc and transfer files by using a network to the user's web browser. It is used by a computer or collection of
                    computers to provide content to several users over the internet. This exchange was done with the help of HTTP communicating between the browser and the server. There are some examples of web servers given below; you can also download
                    these web servers from given below download links:<br />

                    <br /> WEB CLIENTS:-<br /> -----------
                    <br />
                    <br /> Definition - What does Web Client mean?<br />
                    <a href=" "><a href=" ">The Web client is a client-side component within the Java 2 Platform
                            Enterprise Edition (J2EE), a distributed multi-tiered application model used for building
                            and developing enterprise applications. Client-side components are typically computer
                            applications running on a user's computer and connect to a server. These components perform
                            client-side operations as they might need access to information available only on the client
                            side, like user input, or because the server lacks the processing power necessary in such
                            operations.<br /></a></a>
                    <br />
                    <a href=" ">J2EE is comprised of a client-tier, Web-tier, business-tier, and enterprise information
                        system (EIS)-tier. Components that run on the client side of a machine are client-tier
                        components.<br /></a>
                    <br />
                    <a href=" ">A client-tier component may be an application or Web client. A Web client contains two
                        parts: dynamic Web pages and the Web browser. Dynamic Web pages are produced by components that
                        run in the Web tier, and a Web browser delivers Web pages received from the server.<br /></a>
                    <br /> A Web client is also known as a thin client because it does not execute heavy-duty operations such as querying databases, performing complex business tasks, or connecting to legacy applications. Heavy-duty operations are performed
                    by the J2EE server, which is secure, fast, and reliable.<br />
                    <br />
                    <br /> HOW TO SERVERS AND CLIENTS WORKS:<br /> --------------------------------
                    <br />
                    <br /> In general, all of the machines on the Internet can be categorized as two types: servers and clients. Those machines that provide services (like Web servers or FTP servers) to other machines are servers. And the machines that
                    are used to connect to those services are clients. When you connect to Yahoo! at www.yahoo.com to read a page, Yahoo! is providing a machine (probably a cluster of very large machines), for use on the Internet, to service your request.
                    Yahoo! is providing a server. Your machine, on the other hand, is probably providing no services to anyone else on the Internet. Therefore, it is a user machine, also known as a client. It is possible and common for a machine to be
                    both a server and a client, but for our purposes here you can think of most machines as one or the other.
                    <br />
                    <br /> A server machine may provide one or more services on the Internet. For example, a server machine might have software running on it that allows it to act as a Web server, an e-mail server and an FTP server. Clients that come
                    to a server machine do so with a specific intent, so clients direct their requests to a specific software server running on the overall server machine. For example, if you are running a Web browser on your machine, it will most likely
                    want to talk to the Web server on the server machine. Your Telnet application will want to talk to the Telnet server, your e-mail application will talk to the e-mail server, and so on...<br />

                    </h1>
                    A web resource, or simply resource, is any identifiable thing, whether digital, physical, or abstract.The target of an HTTP request is called a "resource ", whose nature isn't defined further; it can be a document, a photo, or anything else. Each resource
                    is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) used throughout HTTP for identifying resources.
                    <br />
                    <br /> The identity and the location of resources on the Web are mostly given by a single URL (Uniform Resource Locator, a kind of URI). There are sometimes reasons identity and location are not given by the same URI: HTTP uses a specific
                    HTTP header, Alt-Svc when the resource requested wants the client to access it at another location.
                    <br /> There are two types of web resource programs based on the web page they generate.
                    <br />
                    <br /> 1. Static web resource programs: generates static web pages.<br />
                    <br /> Example: HTML.<br />
                    <br /> 2. Dynamic web resource programs: generates dynamic web pages.<br /> Example:Servlet Program, JSP Program, ASP.net program and etc…..<br /> Static web page contains fixed content forever. The content of dynamic web page change
                    based on the input values of the request or time of the request generation.

                    </h1>
                    ABOUT URL:<br />
                    <br /> • URL is a Uniform Resource Locator. Another name for it is a URI, or Uniform Resource Identifier. A URL is <br /> nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. Such resources can be an HTML page, a <br
                    /> CSS document, an image, etc. The resource represented by the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it <br /> is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.<br />
                    <br /> -> Uniform:<br />
                    <br /> A URL/URI is called Uniform for two reasons:<br /> • The URL format is a uniform format — all URLs are structured the same way. There is a standard.<br /> • For any given resource (web page, file, etc.), there should be one,
                    and only one, URL.<br /> It turns out not to be the case that there is one and only one URL for any given resource — which is why the U <br /> doesn’t stand for “Unique.” There are often multiple URLs that will all reach the same resource.
                    The technical <br /> reasons for this aren’t important, but it’s good to know that it does happen. Good web administrators will <br /> designate one as the canonical URL, or the “official” one. This provides a uniform way of accessing
                    the given <br /> resource.
                    <br />
                    <br /> -> Resource:<br />
                    <br /> A web page is a resource. Why not call the address a UPL — a Uniform Page Locator? Because not all URLs <br /> point to pages:<br /> • Images are not pages, they are files. Every image on the internet has a URL — if it didn’t
                    have a <br /> URL, you wouldn’t be able to access.<br /> • Other types of media also have URLs — video, audio, games.<br /> • Web applications have URLs.<br /> • Web services have URLs. All of the different types of things you can
                    access from the internet via a <br /> URL are called resources.<br />
                    <br /> -> Locator:<br />
                    <br /> The original conception of URLs is that they represented the “address” of a particular resource, where it <br /> could be found. We (that is, humans) continue to think of it that way, but it isn’t really technically <br /> accurate.
                    <br />
                    <br /> -> Identifier:<br />
                    <br /> It is more accurate to talk about URIs as identifying a resource, rather than locating a resource. The URI <br /> tells you (and the computer system) what you are looking for, and then the computer system finds it for <br />                    you.
                    <br />
                    <br /> The Anatomy of a URL:<br />
                    <br />
                    <a href=" ">A URL is made up of several different pieces, each indicating a particular piece of
                        information about the resource. Not every URL will have all of these different components, but
                        all will have some of them.<br /></a> Consider the following example URL:<br />
                    <br /> https://blog.example.com/web-tutorials/addresses.html?userid=123456#section1
                    <br />
                    <br /> -> Protocol: https<br />
                    <br /> Most websites will either use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), or HTTPS, its secure version.
                    <br /> HTTP is the protocol used for transferring web pages, and most other resources, over the internet. If you are logged in or providing sensitive information (like your credit card number), the protocol should be HTTPS.<br /> Other
                    protocols you might see include:<br /> FTP — File transfer protocol. Used for uploading and downloading files.<br /> SPDY — Speedy protocol-Google replacement for HTTP, which is designed to work faster.<br /> SMTP — Simple Mail Transfer
                    Protocol, the protocol used for moving email messages around the internet. You will usually not see this in a browser address bar. <br />
                    <br /> -> Top Level Domain(TLD): .com <br />
                    <br /> The .com domain is usually used for commercial sites. Other TLDs you might see include:<br /> • .org— Usually used for non-profit organizations.<br /> • .gov— Only used by the United States government.
                    <br /> • .edu— Only used by colleges and universities.<br /> • .uk— Sites originating in the United Kingdom. <br />
                    <br /> -> Host Name: blog.example.com<br />
                    <br /> In this case, the host name consists of three parts:<br /> • example.com — This is the domain name.
                    <br /> • blog— This is a subdomain, usually used for a specific subsite within a larger domain. The most common subdomain is WWW, which stands for World Wide Web. It is used by some domains to indicate publicly accessible content.
                    <br /> • Blog.example.com— Taken all together, this is called the host name, or (less frequently) the server name<br />
                    <br /> -> Path: /web-tutorials/addresses.html<br />
                    <br /> /web-tutorials/addresses.html — This is called the path. It tells the hosting server <br /> • /web-tutorials/ is a directory, like a file folder on your computer. In fact, sometimes it is a file folder on the server, though
                    not always. On many websites, especially blogs, the directory represents categories. Shopping sites might have a long hierarchy of categories.<br /> • addresses.html— This is the resource name. It might be a page name or a file name.<br
                    /> • html— This is the file extension. Just like on your home computer, this indicates the type of file it is.<br />
                    <br /> .html is the typical file extension for websites. Other common extensions for websites include .php and .asp. Many non-page files on the web have other extensions.jpg .gif.pdf .js Many pages don’t use a file extension at all.<br
                    />
                    <br /> -> Parameters: ?userid=123456<br />
                    <br /> userid=123456— This is called a parameter. It is used to encode some specific date into the URL, for use by the server. In this case, it appears to indicate that a user with the id 123456 is requesting the page.<br /> Each parameter
                    is made up of a few different parts:<br /> • The question mark (?) indicates the beginning of a list of parameters.<br /> • Each parameter has a name and a value.<br /> • The name of this parameter is userid, and the value is 123456<br
                    /> • The name and value are separated by an equals signs ( = ).
                    <br /> Sometimes there will be multiple parameters. If that is the case, the parameters are separated by the ampersand sign ( & ), like this: ?userid=123456&color=green<br />
                    <br /> -> Named Anchor: #section1<br />
                    <br /> #section1 — This is a named anchor, which links to a specific location on the page; in this case, section 1. Named anchors can be used to link to a specific time-stamp on a video, a specific set of coordinates on a map, or a
                    specific section on a text document.<br />

                    </center><br />
                    <p>When a client and a web service communicate they exchange messages. A request message is sent from the client to the web service. The web service responds with a response message. This is just like in ordinary HTTP, where a web browser
                        sends an HTTP request to a web server, and the web server replies with an HTTP response.</p>
                    <br />
                    <br><br />
                    <p>In the beginning the only web service message format available was SOAP. Later came REST type web services, which uses plain XML and HTTP. Following the REST movement came a wave of people using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as
                        message format. Another very simple remoting protocol is called XML-RPC (XML Remote Procedure Call). Of these, the most common is SOAP and I will not get into details with these message formats here, since they will get their own
                        tutorial trails later. I will just briefly mention what they look like.</p><br />

                    <p>The same SOAP message structure is used to send both requests and responses between client and web service.SOAP doesn't specify how a message gets from the client to the web service, although the most common scenario is via HTTP.</p><br
                    />
                    <h2><b>REST+XMl:</b></h2><br />
                    <p>REST(Representational State Transfer) style web services work a bit different from SOAP web services. A REST request is a simple HTTP request just like a regular browser would send to a web server.There is typically no XML request
                        sent. A REST response is typically an XML document sent back in a regular HTTP response, just as if a browser had requested it.</p><br />
                    <h3>Syntax of http message:</h3><br />
                    <p>HTTP message consists of an initial request line and an initial response line.</p><br />
                    <h4>Format:HTTP-message = Request | Response ; HTTP/1.1 messages</h4> <br />
                    <h3>1.Initial Request Line:</h3><br />
                    <p>The initial line is different for the request and for the response. A request-line consists of three parts: a method name, requested resource's local path, and the HTTP version being used. All these parts are separated by spaces.</p><br
                    />
                    <h3>Syntax:</h3><br />
                    <h4>GET /path/to/file/index.html HTTP/1.0</h4><br />
                    <h4>GET is the most common HTTP methodThe path shows the part of the URL after the host name. It is also called a request URI.The version of HTTP always takes the form “HTTP/x.x”, uppercase.</h4>
                    <br />
                    <h3>1.Initial Response Line:</h3><br />
                    <p>The initial Response line is also known as the status line. It also has three parts: the HTTP version, a response status code that gives the result of the request, and the English reason phrase describing the status code.</p><br />
                    <h3>Example:</h3><br />
                    <h4>HTTP/1.0 200 OK or HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found </h4><br />
                    <h3>Message Header:</h3><br />
                    <p>The Message header provides information about the request and response. It also provides information about the object which is sent in the message body. Message Headers are of four types:
                        <br />
                        <br /> 1.General Header: It has general applicability for both request messages and response messages.
                        <br /> 2.Request Header: It has applicability only for the request messages.<br /> 3.Response Header: It has applicability only for the response messages.<br /> 4.Entity Header: It defines meta-information about the entity-body,
                        and about the resource identified by request.</h4><br />
                        <h4>Syntax</h4><br />
                        <p>message-header = field-name ": " [ field-value ]</p><br />
                        <h3>Message Body:</h3><br />
                        <p>The message body of an HTTP message is used to carry the entire body associated with the request and response. The message-body differs from the entire-body only when a transfer-coding has been applied, as indicated by the Transfer-Encoding
                            header field.</p><br />
                        <h4>Syntax:</h4><br />
                        <p>message-body = entity-body <br /> |
                            <entity-body encoded as per Transfer-Encoding>
                        </p><br />
                        <h3>Message Length:</h3><br />
                        <p>The transfer-length of a message is the length of the message-body, and it appears in the message.
                        </p><br />
                        <h2><b>REST +JSON:</b></h2><br />
                        <p>REST + JSON is basically the same as REST + XML except that data is transfered in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) instead of XML.</p><br />
                        <h2><b>XML RPC:</b></h2><br />
                        <p>XML RPC is closer to SOAP than it is to REST. XML RPC has both a request and a response format. XML RPC is a somewhat simpler protocol than SOAP</p><br />

                    </h1>
                    Non-Persistent & Persistent Connection:<br /> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol that uses TCP as an underlying transport and typically runs on port 80. HTTP is a stateless protocol i.e. server
                    maintains no information about past client requests.<br /> HTTP Connections:<br /> 1.Non-Persistent connections
                    <br /> 2.Persistent connections<br /> Before starting with persistent and non-persistent HTTP connection lets know what is a RTT.<br /> RTT-> Time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back.<br /> RTT= 2*propagation
                    time
                    <br /> 1. For an connection Persistent or Non-persistent it is sure that to initiate TCP connection one RTT is used.<br /> 2. One RTT is used for HTTP request and first few bytes to HTTP response to return.<br />
                    <br /> • Total file transmission time=2RTT+transmit time<br />
                    <br /> Nonpersistent connections: It requires connection setup again and again for each object to send. Non-persistent connection is known as HTTP 1.0 <br /> -> Requires 2RTTs per object.<br /> -> Server leaves connection close after
                    sending response.<br /> -> Browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch refernced objects.
                    <br /> -> It has two types:1.Without parallel connection<br /> 2.With parallel connection
                    <br /> Without parallel connection:<br /> Each objection takes two RTT (assuming no window limit) one for TCP connection and other for HTTP image/text file.<br /> For example,Assume that you have base HTML file with 10 images&files
                    .How many RTT are required?<br /> We know that ,for each object requires 2RTTs<br /> For 10 images=2*10=20RTT<br /> Total time=2RTT+20RTT<br /> =22RTT
                    <br /> With parallel connections:<br /> It allows the clients to make multi connections.<br /> Assuming the above example with 5 parallel connections.<br /> Here 5 images can be sent simultaneously.
                    <br /> So for 10 images it takes 2*(10/5)=4RTT.
                    <br /> Total time =2RTT+4RTT<br /> =6RTT.
                    <br /> Persistent connections: It does not require connection setup again and again. Multiple objects can use connection. Persistent connection is known as HTTP 1.1.<br /> -> Server leaves connection open after sending response.<br
                    /> -> Subsequent HTTP messages between same clien/server sent over open connection.<br /> -> Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object.
                    <br /> -> One RTT for all the referenced objects.<br /> -> It has two types:<br /> 1. Non-pipelined
                    <br /> 2. Pipelined<br />
                    <br /> Non-pipeline connection:<br /> In non-pipeline connection we first establish connection which takes two RTT then we send all the objects images/text files which takes 1 RTT each (TCP for each object is not required).<br /> Assuming
                    same example,<br /> So for 10 images it requires -> 30 RTTs<br /> Total time = 2 RTT + 10 RTT <br /> = 12RTT<br />
                    <br /> Pipelined connection:<br /> In pipelined connection 2RTT for connection establishment and then 1RTT(assuming no window limit) for all the objects i.e. images/text.<br /> Assuming the example,
                    <br /> In Pipe-lining connection we can send all images in 1RTT.<br /> Total time = 2 RTT + 1 RTT = 3RTT<br />

                    <p>Web caching is the activity of storing data for reuse, such as a copy of a web page served by a web server.</p><br />
                    <p>It is cached or stored the first time a user visits the page and the next time a user requests the same page, a cache will serve the copy, which helps keep the origin server from getting overloaded.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Web caching solutions and strategies enhance page delivery speed significantly and reduce the work needed to be done by the backend server.</p><br />
                    <p>Caching servers can be set to refresh at specific intervals or in response to certain events to ensure that the freshest content is cached (useful for rapidly changing information, such as breaking news or rapidly changing pricing).</p><br
                    />
                    <p>Caching can also protect against total outages, delivering already cached content when servers are down.</p><br />
                    <h2><b>Systems:</b></h2><br />
                    <p>Web caches can be used in various systems</p><br />
                    <h3>Forward Position System(recipient or client-side):</h3><br />
                    <p>A forward cache is a cache outside the Web server's network.For example, if the back button is pressed, the locally cached version of a page may be displayed instead of a new request being sent to the Web server. A Web proxy sitting
                        between the client and the server can evaluate HTTP headers and choose whether to store Web content.
                    </p><br />
                    <h3>Reverse Position System(content provider or web-server side):</h3><br />
                    <p>A reverse cache sits in front of one or more Web servers and Web applications, accelerating requests from the Internet, reducing peak Web server load. A content delivery network (CDN) can retain copies of Web content at various points
                        throughout a network.A search engine may also cache a website; it provides a way of retrieving information from websites that have recently gone down or a way of retrieving data more quickly than by clicking the direct link. Google,
                        for instance, does so. Links to cached contents may be found in Google search results.</p><br />
                    <h2><b>Cache-Control:</b></h2><br />
                    <p>HTTP defines three basic mechanisms for controlling caches: freshness, validation, and invalidation
                    </p><br />
                    <h3>Freshness:</h3><br />
                    <p>allows a response to be used without re-checking it on the origin server, and can be controlled by both the server and the client.</p><br />
                    <h3>Validaton:</h3><br />
                    <p>can be used to check whether a cached response is still good after it becomes stale.</p><br />
                    <h3>Invalidation:</h3><br />
                    <p>is usually a side effect of another request that passes through the cache.</p><br />

                    Proxy server is an intermediary server between client and the internet. Proxy servers offers the following basic functionalities:<br />
                    <br /> * Firewall and network data <br /> filtering.
                    <br /> * Network connection sharing<br /> * Data caching<br />

                    <br /> * Content Filtering<br />
                    <br /> * Filtering encrypted data<br />
                    <br /> * Bypass filters<br />
                    <br /> * Logging and eavesdropping<br />
                    <br /> Improving performance:<br /> It fasten the service by process of retrieving content from the cache which was saved when previous request was made by the client.<br />
                    <br /> Translation:
                    <br /> It helps to customize the source site for local users by excluding source content or substituting source content with original local content. In this the traffic from the global users is routed to the source website through
                    Translation proxy.<br />
                    <br /> Accessing services anonymously:<br /> In this the destination server receives the request from the anonymzing proxy server and thus does not receive information about the end user.<br />
                    <br /> Security:
                    <br /> Since the proxy server hides the identity of the user hence it protects from spam and the hacker attacks.<br />
                    <br /> Types of proxies:<br />
                    <br /> 1.Forward Proxies:<br /> In this the client requests its internal network server to forward to the internet.<br />
                    <br /> Open Proxies:<br /> Open Proxies helps the <br /> clients to conceal their IP address while browsing the web.<br />
                    <br />
                    <br /> 2.Reverse Proxies:<br /> In this the requests are forwarded to one or more proxy servers and the response from the proxy server is retrieved as if it came directly from the original Server.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Proxy user interface:<br /> This module controls and manages the user interface and provides an easy to use graphical interface, window and a menu to the end user. This menu offers the following functionalities:<br />
                    <br /> 1.Start proxy<br />
                    <br /> 2.Stop proxy<br />
                    <br /> 3.Exit
                    <br />
                    <br /> 4.Blocking URL<br />
                    <br /> 5.Blocking client<br />
                    <br /> 6.Manage log<br />
                    <br /> 7.Manage cache<br />
                    <br /> 8.Modify configuration<br />
                    <br /> Proxy server listener:<br /> It is the port where new request from the client browser is listened. This module also performs blocking of clients from the list given by the user.<br />
                    <br /> Connection Manager:<br /> It contains the main functionality of the proxy server. It performs the following functions:<br />
                    <br /> Read request from header of the client.<br />
                    <br /> Parse the URL and determine whether the URL is blocked or not.<br />
                    <br /> Generate connection to the web server.<br />
                    <br /> Read the reply from the web server.<br />
                    <br /> If no copy of page is found in the cache then download the page from web server else will check its last modified date from the reply header and accordingly will read from the cache or server from the web.<br />
                    <br /> Then it will also check whether caching is allowed or not and accordingly will cache the page.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Cache Manager:<br /> This module is responsible for storing, deleting, clearing and searching of web pages in the cache.<br />
                    <br /> Log Manager:<br /> This module is responsible for viewing, clearing and updating the logs.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Configuration:
                    <br /> This module helps to create configuration settings which in turn let other modules to perform desired configurations such as caching.

                    </h1>
                    Java and Microsoft .NET are two leading technologies intended for development of desktop and server-side applications. Both platforms enable the use of high-level programming languages to build large-scale applications. While both Java and .NET are often
                    referred to as frameworks, only .NET is actually a framework in the strictest meaning of this word. In fact, the .NET platform uses ASP.NET as a web application framework to allow developers to create web apps.<br
                    />
                    <br /> The Core Differences between Java and .NET<br /> The main difference between Java and .NET is that Java, usually Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), can work on any operating system, while .NET works only on various versions of Windows.
                    While a limited number of open-source implementations of .NET are available, this framework is still targeting Windows users. At the same time, Java takes advantage of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which follows the concept that
                    code should run on any device and under any operating system, thus making itself a portable and platform-independent programming tool.<br /> Both platforms provide support for common programming languages such as PHP, Ruby, and Python.
                    Java developers can also use languages such as Java, JavaScript, Clojure, Groovy, and Scala while .NET developers can code in C#, F#, VB.NET, C++, and .NET. The two platforms also support other, less popular languages. However, the
                    J2EE framework sets Java as a default language, while .NET is compatible with other languages such as C#, F#, and VB.net. This is a more flexible approach to development of business apps, although it requires more varied coding skills.<br
                    /> Another substantial difference is related to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that each platform requires. Basically, an IDE is a software suite that provides must-have tools for a developer to build and test software
                    applications. The default IDE for .NET applications is Microsoft Visual Studio, which is a sophisticated tool to build apps. Java developers can select between four main IDEs available on the market. These are Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea,
                    Oracle NetBeans, and Oracle JDeveloper.<br /> Image for post<br /> According to the statistics by the job search site Indeed, Java developers are in higher demand than .NET ones, and job seekers perform more searches for Java jobs
                    compared to searches for positions requiring .NET skills.<br /> more expensive compared to other frameworks.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Java and .NET: Which Platform to Choose<br /> Evidently, Java and .NET have a bit different approach to software development when it comes to IDEs and portability. Nonetheless, both platforms pursue the same goals and target
                    the same market segment: scalable enterprise applications and online solutions.<br /> Image for post
                    <br /> One of the major factors to consider when choosing between Java and .NET is whether you have access to particular development skills. Some companies have large in-house development teams, but others rely on outsourcing to reliable
                    software development teams such as .NET developers from Itransition. Another factor to consider is whether you have the required infrastructure to support a complex app or website built with .NET, or you need a more flexible approach
                    that Java-based solutions can offer.<br /> You can build excellent software on both .NET and Java, having in mind that .NET developers are harder to find. This doesn’t mean you need no assistance from knowledgeable Java development
                    consultants to build a complex application using Java.<br /> Overall, it is easier to build sophisticated apps that deal with more users or handle larger amounts of data in Java. The .NET framework is considered more advantageous when
                    delivery of web-based content is concerned and you need to design a richer graphic user interface (GUI).
                    <br /> The widespread view that .NET is more appropriate when you create enterprise-level solutions is misleading, though. Enterprise-level apps, websites, and online services are created mainly in PHP, and only then ASP.NET and Java
                    come in line. According to SimilarTech, the PHP framework is powering some 19 percent of all online solutions, but you should be aware that PHP is also available for developers in both .NET and Java environments.<br /> Interoperability
                    is a field where .NET trails Java, especially when you need open-source compatibility. A growing number of organizations implement open source solutions, even in advanced fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
                    As a result, Microsoft is looking for the way to close the gap in the .NET framework’s interoperability beyond Windows and integrate with open-source tools and platforms closer.<br /> Finally, you need to evaluate the project costs
                    against each of the platforms. If you rely mostly on Windows-based software to run your business and you are a loyal client of Microsoft products, you may need to opt for a .NET-powered solution to minimise expenditures. If you select
                    a Java solution to reduce costs, you need to assess a good number of related software and supporting tools to choose the right mix of Java tools.<br /> Summing up, there is no wrong or right choice between .NET and Java. It all depends
                    on available development skills, underlying infrastructure, requirements for interoperability, and end-user environments, since both platforms actually provide very similar features and functionality.

                    </h1>
                    Looking Up Internet Addresses:<br />
                    <br /> Devices connected to the Internet are called nodes. Nodes that are computers are called hosts. Each node or host is identified by at least one unique 32-bit number called an Internet address, an IP address, or a host address,
                    depending on who you talk to. This takes up exactly four bytes of memory. An IP address is normally written as four unsigned bytes, each ranging from to 255, with the most significant byte first. Bytes are separated by periods for
                    the convenience of human eyes. For example, the address for hermes.oit.unc.edu is 152.2.21.1. This is called the dotted quad format.<br />
                    <br /> IP addresses are great for computers, but they are a problem for humans, who have a hard time remembering long numbers. In the 1950s, it was discovered that most people could remember about seven digits per number; some can
                    remember as many as nine, while others remember as few as five. This is why phone numbers are broken into three- and four-digit pieces with three-digit area codes.[13] Obviously an IP address, which can have as many as 12 decimal digits,
                    is beyond the capacity of most humans to remember. I can remember about two IP addresses, and then only if I use both daily and the second is a simple permutation of the first.<br />
                    <br /> To avoid the need to carry around Rolodexes full of IP addresses, the designers of the Internet invented the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS associates hostnames that humans can remember (like hermes.oit.unc.edu ..<br />
                    <br /> IP Address Location :<br />
                    <br /> Your IP Location can be found using our IP Lookup tool. No IP Lookup tool is 100% accurate due to many different factors. Some of those factors include where the owner of the IP has it registered. Furthermore, where the agency
                    that controls the IP is located, proxies, cellular IPs, etc. If you are in the US and the controlling agency of the IP is located in Canada. Moreover, chances are the results will show as Canada. Showing a Canadian IP while in the
                    northern US is very common among mobile users on the Verizon network.<br />
                    <br /> IP Address Results:<br />
                    <br /> Often, people think if they perform an IP address lookup, that they are going to find the physical mailing address of the user assigned the IP in question. This is simply not true. At this time, we are not aware of any IP address
                    database that will give you the exact physical postal address of the IP address you lookup. At best, you'll get the exact city in which the user of the IP is located. For an exact physical address you would need to contact the ISP
                    (Internet Service Provider) of the IP address in question.<br />
                    <br /> However, without a police warrant, or some sort of legal document forcing the ISP to turn over the information. Don't expect them to give you the mailing address of the user that received the assignment of the IP at the time
                    you received the offensive email. Moreover, even other means of offensive / questionable communication from said IP.<br />

                    <h5><strong>CLIENT-SERVER MODEL:</strong></h5><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <p>client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.Often clients and servers communicate
                        over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its
                        resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. <br /> Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model
                        are "email, network printing, and the World Wide Web ".</p><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <h6><strong>CLIENT-SERVER ROLE:</strong></h6><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <a href=" ">
                        <p>The client-server characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services. Servers
                            are classified by the services they provide. For example, a web server serves web pages and a file server serves computer files. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components, from
                            programs and data to processors and storage devices. The sharing of resources of a server constitutes a service.</p><br /><br />
                    </a>
                    <br />
                    <p>Whether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that requires the service functions. For example, a single computer can run a web servers and file server software at the same time to
                        serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. Client software can also communicate with server software within the same computer.Communication between servers, such as to synchronize data, is sometimes called
                        "inter-server or server-to-server " communication.</p><br /><br />
                    <h6><strong>CLIENT-SERVER COMMUNICATION:</strong></h6><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <p>In general, a service is an abstraction of computer resources and a client does not have to be concerned with how the server performs while fulfilling the request and delivering the response. The client only has to understand the response
                        based on the well-known application protocol, i.e. the content and the formatting of the data for the requested service.</p><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <p>Clients and servers exchange messages in a request–response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication. To communicate, the
                        computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. The language and rules of communication are defined in a communications protocol. All client-server protocols
                        operate in the application layer. The application layer protocol defines the basic patterns of the dialogue. To formalize the data exchange even further, the server may implement an application programming interface (API).The API
                        is an abstraction layer for accessing a service. By restricting communication to a specific content format, it facilitates parsing. By abstracting access, it facilitates cross-platform data exchange.</P><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <p>A server may receive requests from many distinct clients in a short period of time. A computer can only perform a limited number of tasks at any moment, and relies on a scheduling system to prioritize incoming requests from clients
                        to accommodate them. To prevent abuse and maximize availability, the server software may limit the availability to clients. Denial of service attacks are designed to exploit a server's obligation to process requests by overloading
                        it with excessive request rates. Encryption should be applied if sensitive information is to be communicated between the client and the server.</P><br />

                    <p>When a socket is created, the program has to specify the address domain and the socket type. Two processes can communicate with each other only if their sockets are of the same type and in the same domain. There are two widely used
                        address domains, the unix domain, in which two processes which share a common file system communicate, and the Internet domain, in which two processes running on any two hosts on the Internet communicate. Each of these has its
                        own address format.<br /> The address of a socket in the Unix domain is a character string which is basically an entry in the file system.</p><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <p>The address of a socket in the Internet domain consists of the Internet address of the host machine (every computer on the Internet has a unique 32 bit address, often referred to as its IP address). In addition, each socket needs a
                        port number on that host. Port numbers are 16 bit unsigned integers. The lower numbers are reserved in Unix for standard services. For example, the port number for the FTP server is 21. It is important that standard services be
                        at the same port on all computers so that clients will know their addresses. However, port numbers above 2000 are generally available.</p><br /><br />
                    <br />
                    <p>There are two widely used socket types, stream sockets, and datagram sockets. Stream sockets treat communications as a continuous stream of characters, while datagram sockets have to read entire messages at once. Each uses its own
                        communciations protocol. Stream sockets use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which is a reliable, stream oriented protocol, and datagram sockets use UDP (Unix Datagram Protocol), which is unreliable and message oriented.</P><br

                            mail messages from one mail server to another. The ability to relay messages from one server to another is necessary if the sender and recipient have different email service providers. SMTP, which is specified in RFC 5321,
                            uses port 25 by default. It may also use port 587 and port 465.</p><br />

                            <br /><br /> Connects to the mail server on port 110 (or 995 for SSL/TLS connections);<br /><br /> Retrieves email messages; <br /><br /> Deletes copies of the messages stored on the server; and<br /><br /> Disconnects from

                    •What is POP3?<br /> Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is a standard mail protocol used to receive emails from a remote server to a local email client. POP3 allows you to download email messages on your local computer and read
                    them even when you are offline.<br />

                    <br /> ¶Advantages of POP3:<br />
                    <br /> •Emails are downloaded to the user’s computer. Messages can be read when user is offline.
                    <br /> Opening attachments is quick and easy as they are already downloaded.<br />
                    <br /> •Less server storage space required; all emails are stored on local machine.<br /> Storage capacity of emails limited by the size of your hard disk.<br />
                    <br /> •Very popular, easy to configure and use.<br />
                    <br /> ¶Disadvantages of POP3:<br />
                    <br /> •Emails cannot be accessed from other machines (unless configured to do so).<br /> Exporting the local mail folder to another email client or physical machine can be difficult.<br />
                    <br /> •Email folders can become corrupted, potentially losing the entire mailbox at once.<br />
                    <br /> •Email attachments may contain viruses which may expose the user’s PC to harm if they are opened locally and their virus scanner is unable to detect them.<br />

                    </h1>
                    ¶ What is Remote Method Invocation?<br />
                    <br /> The method invocation statement calls a method defined for the class of a reference variable. This statement is used for methods of user classes, system classes, and external classes. You can invoke any method defined for the
                    class of the reference variable or any inherited method from the variable's superclasses. <br />
                    <br /> ¶Working of RMI:<br />
                    <br /> The communication between client and server is handled by using two intermediate objects: Stub object (on client side) and Skeleton object (on server side).<br />
                    <br /> ¶Stub Object:<br />
                    <br /> The stub object on the client machine builds an information block and sends this information to the server. The block consists of:<br />
                    <br /> •An identifier of the remote object to be used<br /> •Method name which is to be invoked
                    <br /> •Parameters to the remote JVM.<br />
                    <br /> ¶Skeleton Object:<br />
                    <br /> >>The skeleton object passes the request from the stub object to the remote object. >>It performs following tasks<br /> >>It calls the desired method on the real object present on the server.
                    <br /> >>It forwards the parameters received from the stub object to the method.<br />

                    <br />
                    <br /> >>Step 1: Defining the remote interface:<br />
                    <br /> •The first thing to do is to create an interface which will provide the description of the methods that can be invoked by remote clients. This interface should extend the Remote interface and the method prototype within the
                    interface should throw the •RemoteException.<br />
                    <br /> // Creating a Search interface <br />
                    <br /> import java.rmi.*; <br />
                    <br /> public interface Search extends Remote <br /> { <br />

                    <br /> public String query(String search) throws RemoteException; <br /> }
                    <br />
                    <br /> >>Step 2: Implementing the remote interface:<br />
                    <br /> •The next step is to implement the remote interface. To implement the remote interface, the class should extend to UnicastRemoteObject class of java.rmi package. Also, a default constructor needs to be created to throw the java.rmi.RemoteException
                    from its parent constructor in class.<br />
                    <br /> // Java program to implement the Search interface <br />

                    <br /> // Implementation of the query interface <br />
                    <br /> public String query(String search) <br />
                    <br /> throws RemoteException <br />
                    <br /> { <br />
                    <br /> String result; <br />
                    <br /> if (search.equals("Reflection in Java ")) <br />

                    <br />
                    <br /> >>Step 3: Creating Stub and Skeleton objects from the implementation class using rmic:<br /> The rmic tool is used to invoke the rmi compiler that creates the Stub and Skeleton objects. Its prototype is<br /> rmic classname.
                    For above program the following command need to be executed at the command prompt<br /> rmic SearchQuery
                    <br />
                    <br /> >>STEP 4: Start the rmiregistry:<br /> Start the registry service by issuing the following command at the command prompt start rmiregistry<br />
                    <br /> >>STEP 5: Create and execute the server application program<br /> The next step is to create the server application program and execute it on a separate command prompt.<br />
                    <br /> •The server program uses createRegistry method of LocateRegistry class to create rmiregistry within the server JVM with the port number passed as argument.<br /> The rebind method of Naming class is used to bind the remote object

                    </h1>
                    There are different versions and flavors of Html available. When rendering (running) the markup a broswer needs to know what version or flavor was used to design the page, so that i can run it correctly.
                    <br />
                    <br /> To tell the browser about the version of html we used, we use the Doctype declaration. If you have seen some html documents then you might have noticed the declaration already. It look something like this,<br />
                    <br />
                    <!DOCTYPE html
                        PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN " "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd ">
                    <br />
                    <br /> It looks a bit cumbursome, but we can understand what it means by first looking at the flavors of html.<br />
                    <br /> Flavors
                    <br /> Both Html and XHTML supports three flavors,<br />
                    <br /> -->Strict
                    <br /> -->Transitional
                    <br /> -->Frameset
                    <br />
                    <br /> ☆Transitional☆
                    <br />
                    <br /> The Transitional type allows the use of deprecated or presentational elements but frames are not allowed.<br />
                    <br /> ☆Frameset☆
                    <br />
                    <br /> The Frameset type is same as transitional but allows the use of Frames.<br />
                    <br /> ☆Doctype Declaration☆<br />
                    <br /> To define a doctype, we use the
                    <!Doctype> tag on the very first line of code.<br />
                    <br /> Example
                    <br />
                    <br /> The doctype for Xhtml with transitional flavor is written as,<br />
                    <br />
                    <!DOCTYPE html
                        PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN " "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd ">

                        Topic: 2.2: HTML basics
                    </h1>
                    HTML Basics:<br />
                    <br /> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
                    As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
                    <br />
                    <br /> WHAT IS HTML?<br /> HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content
                    to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
                    <br />
                    <br /> ANATOMY OF AN HTML ELEMENT:<br /> Example: <br />
                    <p>MY cat is very grumpy</p><br />
                    <br /> The main parts of our element are as follows:<br />
                    <br /> 1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph
                    begins.
                    <br /> 2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag
                    is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br /> 3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<br /> 4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag and the content
                    together comprise the element.<br />
                    <br /> Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:<br />
                    <br />
                    <p class="editor-note ">My cat is very grumpy</p><br />
                    <br /> Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the
                    element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.<br />
                    <br /> An attribute should always have the following:<br />
                    <br /> 1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).<br /> 2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.<br /> 3. The attribute value wrapped by opening
                    and closing quotation marks.<br />
                    <br /> Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters " ' ` =
                    <> ) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.<br />
                        <br /> ANATOMY OF AN HTML DOCUMENT:<br />
                        <br />
                        <xmp>
                            <!DOCTYPE html><br />
                            <html><br />

                            <head><br />
                                <meta charset="utf-8"><br />
                                <title>My test page</title><br />
                            </head><br />

                            <body><br />
                                <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"><br />

                            </html><br />
                            <br /> Here, we have the following:<br />
                            <br /> 1.
                            <!DOCTYPE html> — the doctype. It is required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could
                            mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much, and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That 's all you need to know for now.<br /> 2.
                            <html>

                            </html> — the
                            <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.<br /> 3.

                            <head></head> — the

                            <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page 's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that
                                you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations and more.<br /> 4.
                                <meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it.
                                There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.<br /> 5.
                                <title></title> — the
                                <title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.<br /> 6.

                                    <body></body> — the

                                    <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks or whatever else.<br />

                    HTML ELEMENTS:<br />
                    <br /> An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:<br />
                    <br />
                    <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname><br /> The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:<br />
                    <br />
                    <h1>My First Heading</h1><br />
                    <p>My first paragraph.</p><br />
                    <br /> Example:
                    <br /> Start tag Element content End tag<br /> 1.
                    <h1> My First Heading </h1><br /> 2.
                    <p> My first paragraph. </p><br /> 3. <br> none none<br />
                    <br /> Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!<br />
                    <br /> Nested HTML Elements<br /> HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).<br />
                    <br /> All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.<br />
                    <br /> The following example contains four HTML elements (
                    <html>,

                    <body>,
                        <h1> and
                            <p>):<br />
                                <br /> Example:
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                    <br />

                                <br /> Example Explained:<br />
                                <br /> The
                                <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.<br />
                                <br /> It has a start tag
                                <html> and an end tag

                                </html>.<br />
                                <br /> Then, inside the
                                <html> element there is a

                                <body> element.<br />
                                    <br /> The

                                    <body> element defines the document's body.<br />
                                        <br /> It has a start tag

                                        <body> and an end tag </body>.<br />
                                        <br /> Then, inside the

                                        <body> element there is two other elements:
                                            <h1> and
                                                <p>.<br />
                                                    <br /> The
                                                    <h1> element defines a heading.<br />
                                                        <br /> It has a start tag
                                                        <h1> and an end tag </h1>.<br />
                                                        <br /> The
                                                        <p> element defines a paragraph.<br />
                                                            <br /> It has a start tag
                                                            <p> and an end tag </p>.<br />
                                                            <br /> NOTE:Never Skip the End Tag<br /> Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag.
                                                            <br />
                                                            <br /> Example:
                                                            <br />

                                                            <body><br />
                                                                <br />
                                                                <p>This is a paragraph<br />
                                                                    <p>This is a paragraph<br />
                                                                        <br />
                                                            </body><br />

                                                            </html><br />
                                                            <br /> However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag!<br />
                                                            <br /> Empty HTML Elements<br /> HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.<br />
                                                            <br /> The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.<br />
                                                            <br /> HTML is Not Case Sensitive<br /> HTML tags are not case sensitive:
                                                            <P> means the same as
                                                                <p>.<br />
                                                                    <br /> The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

                    ATTRIBUTES AND TAGS:-<br />
                    <br /> Tags are the elements of the HTML Document used to specify how the document should be displayed by the browser. <br /> In HTML each tag has its own specific meaning, which is common across all different browsers. Tags have attributes.
                    <br /> Most HTML elements can have attributes:<br /> ->Attributes are associated with each tag to further define the tags. <br /> ->Attributes provide additional information about an element.<br /> -> Attributes are always specified
                    in the start tag. <br /> ->Attributes come in the name/value pairs like:attributename="value".<br /> ->Attributes are specified by spaces,The attribute value must be given in Double quotes.<br /> ->HTML tag codes are not case-sensitive.
                    <br /> In HTML, attributes can be applied to basically any element. They modify the default behaviour of the element or specify certain characteristics (e.g., dimensions):<br />
                    <br /> Syntax:
                    <br />
                    <xmp>
                        <tag attribute1="value" attribute2="value" ....>
                    </xmp><br />
                    <br /> Example:
                    <br />
                    <xmp><img src="image.png" alt="HTML Image height" height="100px"></xmp><br />
                    <br />
                    <br /> HTML attributes come in four basic types:<br /> 1.Required:
                    <br /> Required for an element to work as intended<br /> One or multiple specific elements<br /> 2.Optional:
                    <br /> Changes the element's default functionality<br /> One or multiple specific elements<br /> 3.Global:
                    <br /> Changes the element's default functionality<br /> All elements<br /> 4.Event:
                    <br /> Specifies conditions for a script to run<br /> All elements<br />
                    <br /> HTML attributes are always included in the opening tag. The syntax is rather simple:<br />
                    <xmp>
                        <tag name="value">
                    </xmp><br />
                    <br /> attributes are specified in name-value pairs:<br />
                    <br /> name:- defines the name for the HTML attribute<br />
                    <br /> value:- specifies the value you wish to set for it<br />
                    <br /> HTML attributes are case-insensitive. However, World Wide Web Consortium recommends to write them in lowercase for a neater look. <br /> HTML TAGS ARE OF TWO TYPES:<br /> 1.paired tags:-<br /> These are also r as container tags.The
                    tags are known as paired tags if it has companion tag or closing tag at end. <br /> 2.singular tags:-
                    <br /> These are also known as stand-alone or empty tags.It does not have companion or closings tag. <br />

                                    The SRC Attribute:<br />

                                    The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.<br />
                                    When a web page loads; it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a
                                    web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image
                                    actually stay in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors
                                    will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the
                                    browser cannot find the image.<br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br />
                                    The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for
                                    some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src
                                    attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Example<br />

                    </h1>
                    Logical Tags<br />
<xmp>In HTML there are both logical tags and physical tags. Logical tags are designed to describe (to the browser) the enclosed text’s meaning. An example of a logical tag is the <strong> </strong> tag. By placing text in between these tags you are telling
                                        the browser that the text has some greater importance.<br />
                                        <br /> By default all browsers make the text appear bold when in between the <strong> and </strong> tags, but the point to take away from this is that the strong tag implies the importance of that text. This has
                                        impact with search engines like Google who look for such tags to help figure out what the page is about.<br />
                                        <br /> There are many logical tags and they include:<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong> : Strong – as above.<br /></strong>
                                        <br />
                                        <em> : emphasize – usually renders (made to look like by the browsers) as italic.<br />
<br />
<span> : a neutral inline container. – Read about this distinction below.<br />
<br />
<div> : a neutral block element. – Read about this distinction below.<br />
<br />
Logical tags, as mentioned above, have default ways in which browsers (like IE or Opera) render them. But it is understood that CSS should be used to give them their style, or in other words their ‘look’.<br />
<br />
Physical Tags<br />
Physical tags on the other hand provide specific instructions on how to display the text they enclose. Examples of physical tags include:<br />
<br />
<b> : Makes the text bold.<br /></b>
<br />
<big> : Makes the text usually one size bigger than what’s around it.<br /></big>
<br />
<font> : Used to apply a font-face (like Arial or Helvetica) and font-color.<br /></font>
<br />
<i> : Makes text italic.<br />
<br />
Physical tags are more straightforward; <i> makes the text italic, <b> makes text bold and is used to set the font face and color for the text.</xmp>

                        Topic: 2.7: Frames and Iframe
                    </h1>
                    Frames allow you to have multiple sections of the browser window, called frames, each showing their own .html file within the frame. This used to be common practice when trying to show separate sections of a site in separate sections of the browser window, such as a header at the top, navigation at the side, and the rest was page content that someone could scroll down without making the header and navigation disappear.<br />
<br />
Frame sets are rarely used these days, as the introduction of server side scriping languages such as php and asp allow you to create content pages dynamically. The introduction of HTML5 has also provided new methods of doing page layouts without having to use frames.<br />
<br />
Frame Set - <frameset> ... <br />
<br />
</frameset><br />
<br />
Used instead of the body tag, the frameset tag defines a group of frames. Setting the rows and cols attribute allow you to create the number of frames needed for your layout.<br />
rows="??,??" - To set up multiple frames in rows, replace the question marks by the size of each row, either in pixels or as a percentage. A * can be used as a wild card, for instance: rows="100,*" would give you a top frame of 100 pixels high, and a bottom frame using the rest of the screen.<br />
cols="??,??" - Similar to rows, a number of frames can be set out in columns.<br />
border="?" - Frame border thickness in pixels.<br />
bordercolor="?" - Colour of border between frames. (*)<br />
<br />
Frame - <frame><br />
Each frame within a set will need a frame tag to tell it which web page to load in the frame. It uses the attribute:<br />
src="url" - Filename or URL of page to show in the frame<br />
noresize="noresize" - The frame will not be able to be resized by a visitor<br />
scrolling="auto" - Each frame will have vertical and horizontal scroll bars appear automatically when needed. You can change this by setting the scrolling attribute to yes, no, or auto.<br />
frameborder="auto" - Individual Frame Border. Set to 0, 1 to specify whether or not that frame must have a border.<br />
Unframed Content - <noframes> ... </noframes><br />
<br />
Very old browsers are unable to display frames, and in this case we need to specify what these browsers should display instead of the frames. Even though this is not much of a problem anymore, it is still suggested that you specify unframed content when using frames. Anything between the noframes tags will not be shown in modern browsers that show framed content.<br />
<br />
An inline frame renders using <xmp><iframe> tag.<br />
A document can be embedded into the current document using an inline frame.<br />
Usage of iframe<br />
<iframe> HTML is an inline frame. It embeds one page into another.<br /></xmp>
<br />
Look at the iframe example below, showing its usage together with src property:<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
<br />
                </div>

                    <h1 id="2.8">
                        Topic: 2.8: Images
                    </h1>
                    HTML | Images<br />
Earlier, the webpages used to comprise of only texts, which made them appear quite boring and uninteresting. Fortunately, it wasn’t long enough that the ability to embed images on web pages was added for users. Let’s see how to add images on a webpage.<br />
<br />
Adding images on a webpage :<br />
The “img” tag is used to add images on a webpage. The “img” tag is an empty tag, which means it can contain only a list of attributes and it has no closing tag.<br />
<br />
Syntax :<br />
<br />
<img src="url" alt="some_text"><br />
<br />
Attributes:<br />
<br />
src:<br />
src stands for source. Every image has a src attribute which tells the browser where to find the image you want to display. The URL of the image provided points to the location where the image is stored.<br />
So for example, if your image is called dinosaur.jpg, and it sits in the same directory as your HTML page, you could embed the image like so:<br />
<br />
<img src="dinosaur.jpg"><br />
<br />
If the image was in an images subdirectory, which was inside the same directory as the HTML page (which Google recommends for SEO/indexing purposes), then you'd embed it like this:<br />
<br />
<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"><br />
<br />
You could embed the image using its absolute URL, for <br />
example:<br />
<img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg"><br />
<br />
alt:<br />
If the image cannot be displayed then the alt attribute acts as an alternative description for the image. The value of the alt attribute is an user-defined text.<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"<br />
     alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;it has a large head with long sharp teeth"><br />
The easiest way to test your alt text is to purposely misspell your filename. If for example our image name was spelled dinosooooor.jpg, the browser wouldn't display the image, and would display the alt text instead.<br />
<br />
Setting width and height of Image :<br />
The width and height attributes are used to specify the height and width of an image. The attribute values are specified in pixels by default.<br />
Example:<br />
<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"<br />
     alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;it has a large head with long sharp teeth"<br />
     width="400"<br />
     height="341"><br />
<br />
Adding animated Image: Animated images in .gif format can also be added using the “img” tag.<br />
Example:<br />
<img src = "smiley.gif" alt =  "smiley" style = "width:200px; height:200px;"> <br />
<br />
  Adding titles to Image: Along with the images, titles can also be added to images to provide further information related to the inserted image. For inserting a title, the title attribute is used.<br />
Example:<br />
<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"<br />
     alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;it has a large head with long sharp teeth" width="400" height="341" title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum"><br />
<br />
This gives us a tooltip on mouse hover, just like link titles.<br />
<br />
Setting a border to Image :<br />
 By default, every picture has a border around it. By using the border attribute, the thickness of the border can be changed. A thickness of “0” means that there will be no border around the picture.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"<br />
     alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;it has a large head with long sharp teeth" width="400" height="341" border="5"><br />
<br />
Aligning a Picture: <br />
  By default, an image is aligned at the left side of the page, but it can be aligned to center or right using the align attribute.<br />
Example:<br />
<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"<br />
     alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;it has a large head with long sharp teeth" width="400" height="341" border="5" align="right"><br />
<br />
Adding Image as a Link: <br />
 An image can work as a link with a URL embedded in it. It can be done by using the “img” tag inside an “a” tag.<br />
Example:<br />
<a href="default.html"><br />
<img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" style="width:42px;height:42px<br />
"><br />
</a><br />
<br />
Using Image as a background: An image can be used a background for a webpage.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<body background="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg"><br />
<br />
  <br />
                </div>
                <div>

                        Topic: 2.9: Meta tag
                    </h1>
                    META TAG:<br />
The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.<br />
<br />
<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.<br />
<br />
Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.<br />
<br />
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.<br />
<br />
There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<head><br />
  <meta charset="UTF-8"><br />
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials"><br />
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript"><br />
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe"><br />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"><br />
</head><br />

                        Topic: 2.10: Planning of webpage
                    </h1>
                    process for planning a website:<br />
<br />
A construction without planning will endup disaster. Similarly, building a webpage without planning gives the same result.<br />
<br />
There are few questions you should have clarity on before you build a webpage. If you don't have answers for these questions given below. Probably you shouldn't build a website.<br />
<br />
1) Who is your target market for the new website?<br />
<br />
2) What is the primary objective for the new website?<br />
<br />
3) What are the top 3 goals for the new website (and what are any minor goals)?<br />
<br />
4) How do you differentiate yourself from any competitors?<br />
<br />
5) What content needs to go on the new website and will you be generating the content or will you need a professional copywriter? Do you have a sitemap for the site prepared?<br />
<br />
6) What is the budget for the project?<br />
<br />
I have an even more extensive list that I give our potential clients, but those are the major bits of information you should have squared away before even considering the design/development process. If you don't have these answers it could cause delays, miscommunication and generally prevent a successful project. It's also good to have a general idea about design in your mind. Having the attitude of, "I'll know it when I see it" will not only cause delays, but will also cost you a lot of money!<br />
<br />
Once you're ready to start the design/development process:<br />
<br />
Good project management is the key once you're under contract and officially begin the design/development process. Things such as milestones and deliverables, research into target market and competition, information gathering, questions and answers, site architecture and functionality, etc. should all be taken care of before any concept designs are created.<br />
<br />
The next step should be wireframing and finalization of the site structure and functionality. Revisions at this stage are easy to accomplish and the process helps to avoid, "surprises" once the design and programming starts. Image selection, color pallets and other design elements can also be squared away in this phase.<br />
<br />
Design concepts should happen next with revisions to achieve the final concept. At that point, development begins (coding, etc.). Creation of content for the site should be taking place concurrently and a delivery already mapped out so that content does not delay the final testing and launch.<br />
<br />
Once development is complete a testing process should occur that includes error checking and testing on various browsers.<br />
<br />
Of course this is a very succinct explanation of the process but the basics are here.<br />
<br />
It's also important to include the client in each step of the process, clearly explain what is to be done during that phase and get a, "sign off" or approval before moving on to the next phase.

                    </h1>
                    What is Website Structure?<br />
<br />
Site structure or website architecture refers to how your website is designed or how various pages on your website are connected for excellent user experience. This is important not just from the user’s perspective but also for search engine optimization.<br />
<br />
What is Website Structure<br />
What are the types of website structure?<br />
<br />
Hierarchical Model:-<br />
This is the most common and preferred type of website structure. This is also known as a tree structure, where there is a parent page with a broad set of information, and it is further categorized into child pages with detailed information.<br />
<br />
Sequential Model:-<br />
As the name says, this allows the user to browse in a sequential manner. Here, the user can only travel in a forward or backward direction.<br />
<br />
Matrix Model:-<br />
This was popularly used in the early years of the internet. It provided the user with many relevant links under various topic groups, allowing them to choose where they wanted to go next.<br />
<br />
Database Model:-<br />
This is a dynamic approach to website architecture, integrating a database with a search. With this website structure, users can create experiences based on their search query.<br />
<br />
What is the importance of Website structure?<br />
<br />
A smooth user experience<br />
If your website is appealing and informative and has hassle-free navigation, users will want to spend more time on it, increasing the dwell-time and decreasing the bounce time. This will, in turn, indicates to Google that your website is an excellent result to be displayed for a search query and can boost your rankings.<br />
<br />
Good site structure can get you sitelinks<br />
Sitelinks on a SERP show your website’s important pages. These are of a great SEO advantage and can improve clickthrough rate, better your brand’s reputation and help you rank better on SERPs. Google awards sitelinks to websites with excellent site structure. Currently, you cannot add a sitelink on your own.<br />
<br />
Improved Crawling:<br />
A properly designed website structure with good internal linking will help not only users but also crawlers that crawl your website by letting them discover important pages.<br />
<br />
Prevents from competing with your website<br />
Sometimes, you may have different blog posts written around the same topic. If your site is designed correctly, it can help you avoid having competing webpages and keyword cannibalization.<br />
<br />
How to design an SEO-friendly website structure?<br />
<br />
Strategize before you start<br />
The best way to do things is to plan before executing them. Grab a paper and pen, and draw a rough sketch of how your website should look. You can list down various important pages, categories and product pages. This can help you get a better understanding of your website’s skeletal system. If you are starting a new website, it is good to consider implementing various SEO techniques at the designing stage itself. Choosing the right website model is important here. A flat site structure where all pages are just one click away from your home page can sound easy to implement. However, when asked about the flat site structure, this is how John Mueller responded:<br />
<br />
“In general, I’d be careful to avoid setting up a situation where normal website navigation doesn’t work. So, we should be able to crawl from one URL to another URL on your website just by the links on the page.”<br />
<br />
Here, he is saying that a flat website structure can cause crawl issues and difficulty in navigation for users. He further explained: <br />
<br />
“If that’s not possible then we lose a lot of contexts. So if we’re only seeing these URLs through your sitemap file then we don’t really know how these URLs are related to each other and it makes it really hard for us to be able to understand how relevant is this piece of content in the context of your website”<br />
<br />
John’s remark makes it clear that using a hierarchical site structure helps Google understand your website better. <br />
<br />
Website Symmetry is important<br />
If you eliminate the colors, fonts, kernel, graphics and images from a website, a good website structure is what remains. And maintaining symmetry in the structure can be satisfying to the user. Keep your category count between 2 to 7 and try to add an equal number of sub-categories in each category. Symmetricity will prevent your website from looking uneven.<br />
<br />
URL structure:<br />
The URL structure should follow the page hierarchy. If you already have a good website structure, this won’t be much of an issue. However, pay close attention to the ‘slug’. A slug refers to the tail end of the URL. Using a readable name in the slug instead of the ID number of the page helps crawlers and users to better read and understand the content of the page.<br />
<br />
Internal Linking:<br />
Internal linking is a crucial SEO technique which helps you connect one webpage to another on your website. This enhances the user experience as important pages are accessible with fewer clicks. Implementing a good internal linking strategy can help with a good flow of link juice within the domain. Thus, your website can rank better on the SERP.<br />
<br />
W3C Validation:<br />
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) validation is a process to check the compliance of the HTML and XHTML documents of your website to well-formed markup. W3C validation ensures that the site works the same in all browsers.<br />
<br />
Use suitable JavaScript framework along with HTML and CSS<br />
When designing your website, using HTML and CSS are the safest methods. However, using JavaScript can make your site appealing to the users. You need to use a suitable JavaScript framework for your website. With the introduction of the Google Evergreen bot, the crawler can now render more than 1000 web platform features that it could not earlier, making SEO easier. <br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
A website structure is a result of precise thinking and organization. It is a vital aspect of SEO and should be done before the creation of your website. However, if your website is live, you can always rework on the design and improve its structural organization for SEO. It can help both the users and crawlers with easy navigation. So, do not hesitate to invest your time and resources to create an SEO-friendly website.

<h2><u>Introduction to Design</u></h2><br />
<p> Building a website or a web page is not a thing that can be done easily. The bigger the site, the more complexity you would have to handle. You require planning, gathering requirements, analyzing, designing and then starting to build the site. Each step mentioned is important as the other and only when all of them are performed together, can we achieve a site that is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.</p><br />
<p>Websites can be built even without any of the steps mentioned above, but it will definitely make your task difficult. Designing them in advance provides you a road map to follow and a task list to maintain so that you never miss out anything and the work progresses in a smooth manner.</p><br />
<p>Another important aspect to concentrate on designing web pages before implementing them is, it reduces the waste of time and money. Web Development is also a costly affair and we do not want to spend our time developing a site only to realize later that this was not what we or the client wanted. Designing reduces these turn backs</p><br />
<p>Having web pages designed in advance has become crucial these days and separate fields such as UI designer, Interaction Designer have been created to address these issues. So you see how important Designing web pages it.</p><br />
<p>Now Lets's see what composes the process of designing web pages!! Hop on</p><br />
<br />
<h2><u>The First Step</u></h2><br />
<p> All websites are not the same. Each website has it's own cause, own principles, own architecture and own design. Before designing any site, the first thing you must do is <q>Identify what you are trying to achieve with the web page</q>. It is a very important aspect of any webdesign.</p><br />
<p> There are some standards that have to be met in a web page belonging to a particular category. For example any shopping site must have a sign up option. So, <b> Identifying your goal </b> narrows down things very much. And this is the first step you have to do before starting to build the site.</p><br />
<p>Once your purpose is clear, the focus shifts towards what action you want visitors to take when they land on your website. Is your site there just to display information? To sell products? To get sign-ups?<br />
The answer to this will ultimately dictate how your website looks and feels. Using ecommerce as an example, one crucial element of your design is your landing page.</p><br />
<br />
<h2><u>Layouts</u></h2><br />
<p>Layouts refer to the aspect of the appearance of different elements on the screen. A layout defines how a user views a website or web page. Layouts refer to the placement of all the elements. Preparing a layout also involves a set of principles and guidelines along with researches, so that for an application or a site that particular layout is suitable.<br />
 There are many layouts available and each layout is used for a different purpose.Let us look at some of them</p><br />
<h3><b>1. Absolute Layout</b></h3><br />
<p>Absolute layout refers to the placement of the elements in exact specific locations. It allows you to  allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. We use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right to set the location.<br />
These values will be relative to the next parent element with absolute positioning or any other positioning.. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element itself meaning it will be placed relative to the page itself.<br />
An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesn’t affect other elements.<br />
Absolute layouts are minimally used these days, because over use of this layout reduces the flexibility of the site</p><br />
<img src="https://www.webfx.com/blog/images/assets/images.sixrevisions.com/2010/07/19-02_absolute_layout.png" height="300px" width="400px" alt="Absolute Layout Image"><br />
<h3><b>2. Relative Layout</b></h3><br />
<p>Relative positioning and layouts adjust in size depending on the size of the user’s browser viewport(visible area of the webpage)</p><br />
<p> Relative Layout means the elements are placed and replaced relative to themselves! Even here we use the terms top, bottom, left , right, but here instead of referring to the parent element, all the attributes refer to itself. If you give it some positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where <b>it would normally be.</b></p><br />
<p>. Any element that is a child of the relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block.</p><br />
<p>this type of layout relies on everything working at 100% width, whether it’s a small screen (like a netbook) or a 24-inch widescreen desktop monitor. This means that the layout will scale according to the viewer’s situation.</p><br />

<h3><b>3. Fixed Layout</b></h3><br />
<p>A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn’t change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled. </p><br />
<p> The fixed layout keeps the elements where they are exactly even when the screen size doesn't support it, there are situations in which complete sections of the site have been taken out of the viewport. problems can arise from having to scroll in all sorts of directions, and the fixed measurement of a px-based layout has this general issue in spades.</p><br />
<p> There are some situations in which there is a need of fixed layouts such as navigation bars, back ground images, borders and many other non relative images. But these layouts are also used only when the situation demands it</p><br />
<img src="https://www.webfx.com/blog/images/assets/images.sixrevisions.com/2010/07/19-04_fixed_layout.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Fixed Layout Image"><br />
<p> You can look at the fixed layout image</p><br />
<h3><b>4. Elastic Layout</b></h3><br />
<p>One of the most used methods of laying out a design’s content is using the relative em unit of measurement.<br />
Commonly referred to as an elastic layout design (due to the way it flexes by growing and shrinking to meet the content’s needs), it has shown a great deal of appreciation within the web design community due to its ability to scale content, text sizes, and such.<br />
Unlike with fixed units of measurements where absolute-unit elements like images are best suited (due to maintaining without distorting), elastic layouts work best when flexible content (such as text blocks) takes the front seat.</p><br />
<p> the elastic layout type is the most subservient to your content as it gives the content itself the deciding position as to how the layout should scale.</p><br />
<p>Using an elastic solution is perfect if you want the layout to be determined by the content,<//p><br />
<img src="https://www.webfx.com/blog/images/assets/images.sixrevisions.com/2010/07/19-05_elastic_layout.jpg" height="200px" width="300px" alt="elastic layout example"><br />
<h3><b>5. Scaled Layout</b></h3><br />
<p>One of the latest methods in CSS3 allows the manipulation of the available viewport around certain device orientations (i.e. portrait and landscape).<br />
Depending on the way in which the device is held, the design has the potential to alter its visual layout (altering the amount of space given to the content itself). this type of layout does not rely on measurement units, but rather a specific layout type.</p><br />
<p>Scaled layouts truly shine in the smartphone market where the display can be rotated or moved frequently <br />
With such limited space being available on handheld mobile devices, you cannot only maximize the way your pixels are allocated, but you can also allow people the option to choose whichever method they prefer to visualise the information.<br />
Each person will use his or her web-enabled mobile device in a different way, and by allowing your design to relate your content in a transformative way depending on the orientation, you can maximize the usability of your content</p><br />

<p> These are some of the most used layouts and using any of them depends upon the goal of your site and how much flexibility or aesthetic look you want for your site.</p><br />
<h2><u>Sizes and Measurements</u></h2><br />
<p> Before the massive smart phone revolution we used to have standard absolute measurements for the sizes of all elements in the web page, but as desktop screens and smartphone screens started to change almost every other day,  other ways had to be brought in to address the issue.</p><br />
<p> Various measurement sizes we use today are listed below, and choosing the right one for the website your designing is crucial. It is not mandatory to choose only one measurement technique for the complete web page, browsers are capable of rendering multiple measurement standards as long as they are used correctly.</p><br />
<ul><br />
<li><strong>PX</strong>: Pixels (px) are considered absolute units, although they are relative to the DPI and resolution of the viewing device. But on the device itself, the PX unit is fixed and does not change based on any other element. One pixel is essentially one dot on the screen. Most computer screens display 1024 pixels horizontally and 720 pixels vertically.<br />
Using PX can be problematic for responsive sites, but they are useful for maintaining consistent sizing for some elements. If you have elements that should not be resized, then using PX is a good choice.    </li><br />
<li><strong>PT</strong>: Points(pt) is the standard unit of measurement for print typefaces. The standard typeface size for text blocks print media is 10pt or 12pt. The default font size on most Web browsers is 12pt. Points equates differently to pixels depending on the operating system or Web browser. It is, therefore, not a great unit of measurement for screen displays. However, when dealing with vector graphics, points is a good unit of measurement</li><br />
<li><strong>%</strong>: Percentage refers to the width or height of the current element in the box model object. At the root element (aka node) of a Web page (i.e. the body element) the width is 100%. Any element within that element (aka child element) can be sized relative to the parent element. So an element sized to be 50% wide is half the size of it's parent; if the parent is 800px wide, 50% = 400px. Percentage is a great way to produce flexible, accessible layouts on the Web.</li><br />
<li><strong> VH </strong>: VH stands for “viewport height”, which is the viewable screen’s height. 100VH would represent 100% of the viewport’s height, or the full height of the screen.<br />
Viewport units represent a percentage of the current browser viewport (current browser size).<br />
VH is useful for creating full height elements (100%) that fill up the entire viewport’s height. Of course, you can use any percentage of the viewport’s height to achieve other goals, such as 50% for half the height, etc.</li><br />
<li><strong>  VW </strong>:  VW stands for "viewport width", which is the viewable screen's width. 100VW would represent 100% of the viewport's width, or the full width of the screen. VW is useful for creating full width elements (100%) that fill up the entire viewport’s width. Of course, you can use any percentage of the viewport’s width to achieve other goals, such as 50% for half the width, etc.<br />
</ul><br />
<p> Any and all of this measurements can be used in a webpage, all you have to be careful about is the purpose you're using it and whether it is correct to use it over here!</p>

                    </h1>
                    Multimedia Content:-<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
Web browsers and devices that access the Web have evolved greatly over the years. Items for document inclusion have reached far beyond text and images to a variety of objects, including rich media file types such as sound, videos and animation.<br />
Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.<br />
Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.<br />
<br />
Content:-<br />
 Multimedia<br />
 Video clips<br />
 Audio<br />
 Images<br />
<br />
Multimedia:-<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Multimedia represents various types of media content, used together. If we have a text with pictures, we have multimedia. If we add a video, we have multimedia too. The use of multimedia in websites has helped the Internet evolution a lot, since it gave web designers a job and made the web pages much more interesting for everyone. And with today’s connection speeds, we can all enjoy much better looking websites, which are also rich in media content - you can watch a video directly from the site without the need to download it, listen to a song or browse a high quality image gallery. Multimedia content is what shapes the Internet as we know it.<br />
<br />
Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.<br />
<br />
The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.<br />
<br />
Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.<br />
The MP4, WebM, and Ogg formats are supported by HTML.<br />
<br />
The MP4 format is recommended by YouTube.<br />
<br />
Video Clips:-<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Video clips incorporated in a website are all the rage now. Before the YouTube revolution, video clips had to be downloaded before anyone could see them. With the advances in technology, Internet speeds got a lot faster, which allowed for live video streaming over the net, and YouTube-like sites were born. Today, embedding a video clip in a web page is more than easy, and video clips can be easily shared via your blog, forum or even a small video commercial which you can put on your online store - something, which would cost you a fortune if you had to air it on the television.<br />
<br />
  Adding the Video to HTML:-<br />
       The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page.<br />
       Example:-<br />
       -----------<br />
       <video width="320" height="240" controls><br />
        <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br />
        <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"><br />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.<br />
       </video><br />
<br />
Audio:-<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Audio is another thing, which was affected by the technology advances. And while a video clip will require much more bandwidth and server resources, audio files are much faster to process from a server’s point of view. This helped for their distribution among website creators much faster. Today, a website with a musical background is something more than normal, and on a lot of websites you can easily listen to an audio track, which is uploaded on the web server with the help of a simple player. This has also assisted many independent musicians in promoting their music and has allowed even for the creation of Internet music labels.<br />
<br />
   Adding the Audio in Html:-<br />
         The HTML <audio> element is used to play an audio file on a web page.<br />
         Example:-<br />
         --------<br />
         <audio controls><br />
          <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg"><br />
          <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><br />
          Your browser does not support the audio element.<br />
         </audio><br />
<br />
Images:-<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Images were the first type of multimedia to be ever used in a web page. They quickly became an indispensable part of the website design process. Due to the fact that images were pretty small back then, and mostly in the GIF file format, they used very little disk space and bandwidth and were ideal to illustrate every article. This gave birth to the first online news portals, which intended to replace the regular newspapers, offering last minute news without the need to purchase a separate newspaper.<br />
<br />
Images in the websites also inspired the creation of image galleries - websites, dedicated specifically to the display of various pictures, painting or photographs. With the introduction of the thumbnails, galleries and website perfected themselves with the ability to offer a small version of the image as a thumbnail, instead of the full picture.<br />
<br />
Images became also an important part of the layout of a web page - images could now be used for buttons, navigational menus and backgrounds. Today's images are mostly raster graphics (GIF, JPG, PNG, TIFF), with vector graphics not so widely used, mainly due to browser incompatibility.<br />
 <br />
    Adding the image in Html:-<br />
          The HTML <img> element is used to display the image on a web page.<br />
           Example:-<br />
           -----------<br />
           <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli"><br />
         <br />

                        Topic: 2.14: Cascading Style Sheets: Advantages
                    </h1>
                    The CSS coding language was invented by Norwegian programmer Hakon Wium Lie (CTO of Opera Software) in 1994. CSS is defined as a style sheet language that gives web designers control over how a website communicates with web browsers including, the formatting and display of their HTML documents.<br />
                    <br />
                           CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a web design tool used to control the layout of a webpage while HTML deals with  actual content.<br />
                    <br />
                           CSS’s main goal (as a style sheet language) was to separate document content from document presentation, which includes style elements, such as color, layout, and fonts etc. It’s relatively easy to learn and produces better and cleaner code than applying all those styles directly to your HTML.<br />
                          <br />
                    The main ADVANTAGES of using CSS are:<br />
                    <br />
                    >>Easier to maintain and update<br />
                    >>Greater consistency in design<br />
                    >>More formatting options<br />
                    >>Lightweight code<br />
                    >>Faster download times<br />
                    >>Search engine optimization <br />
                      benefits<br />
                    >>Ease of presenting different <br />
                      styles to different viewers<br />
                    >>Greater accessibility<br />
                    <br />
                           CSS has gone through several changes over the years, and the latest version is CSS3. Most web browsers likely support the CSS3 standard. With this latest version, CSS designers have more tools at their disposal.<br />
                           There are different versions of CSS including the kind that is found in the actual HTML code itself, but that defeats the purpose of using CSS in the first place. For better performance and easier maintenance, a separate CSS file is preferred over embedded CSS. If font, text size, or changes in the appearance of any element are to be made later, simply accessing a separate CSS file is much easier than having to go through extensive lines of code in an HTML file.<br />
                    <br />
                             The ADVANTAGES of using a SEPARATE CSS FILE rather than embedding the CSS code inside the HTML file include:<br />
                    <br />
                    >>The layout of a web page is <br />
                     better controlled.<br />
                    >>Style (CSS) kept separate <br />
                      from structure (HTML), means <br />
                      smaller file size.<br />
                    >>Reduced file size means <br />
                     reduced bandwidth, which <br />
                     means faster loading time.<br />
                             <br />
                    *Conclusion:<br />
                    <br />
                           CSS is a leading style sheet programming language today and has been hailed as the future of web development and programming.<br />
                          CSS is a powerful tool as long as you know certain tips, best practices, and avoid problematic issues. With CSS web design, you can adjust the layout of a webpage. Without having to define the appearance for every single element, table, or block of text in the HTML file itself.

                    When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.<br />
<br />
Three Ways to Insert CSS<br />
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:<br />
<br />
External CSS<br />
Internal CSS<br />
Inline CSS<br />
External CSS<br />
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!<br />
<br />
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:<br />
<br />
<!DOCTYPE html><br />
<html><br />
<head><br />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"><br />
</head><br />
<body><br />
<br />
<h1>This is a heading</h1><br />
<p>This is a paragraph.</p><br />
<br />
</body><br />
</html><br />
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.<br />
<br />
The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.<br />
<br />
Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks like:<br />
<br />
"mystyle.css"<br />
body {<br />
  background-color: lightblue;<br />
}<br />
<br />
h1 {<br />
  color: navy;<br />
  margin-left: 20px;<br />
}<br />
Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit (such as margin-left: 20 px;). The correct way is: margin-left: 20px;<br />
<br />
<br />
Internal CSS<br />
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.<br />
<br />
The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:<br />
<br />
<!DOCTYPE html><br />
<html><br />
<head><br />
<style><br />
body {<br />
  background-color: linen;<br />
}<br />
<br />
h1 {<br />
  color: maroon;<br />
  margin-left: 40px;<br />
}<br />
</style><br />
</head><br />
<body><br />
<br />
<h1>This is a heading</h1><br />
<p>This is a paragraph.</p><br />
<br />
</body><br />
</html><br />
Inline CSS<br />
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.<br />
<br />
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element:<br />
<br />
<!DOCTYPE html><br />
<html><br />
<body><br />
<br />
<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1><br />
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p><br />
<br />
</body><br />
</html><br />
Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly.<br />
<br />
Multiple Style Sheets<br />
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. <br />
<br />
Assume that an external style sheet has the following style for the <h1> element:<br />
<br />
h1 {<br />
  color: navy;<br />
}<br />
Then, assume that an internal style sheet also has the following style for the <h1> element:<br />
<br />
h1 {<br />
  color: orange;   <br />
}<br />
Example<br />
If the internal style is defined after the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "orange":<br />
<br />
<head><br />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"><br />
<style><br />
h1 {<br />
  color: orange;<br />
}<br />
</style><br />
</head><br />
Example<br />
However, if the internal style is defined before the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "navy": <br />
<br />
<head><br />
<style><br />
h1 {<br />
  color: orange;<br />
}<br />
</style><br />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"><br />
</head><br />
Cascading Order<br />
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?<br />
<br />
All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:<br />
<br />
Inline style (inside an HTML element)<br />
External and internal style sheets (in the head section)<br />
Browser default<br />
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

<h2><u>Intro About Browser Compatibility</u></h2><br />
New features are released all the time and every technology is updated as time progresses, even while you are reading this sentence a new update might have been released to some application you use. This is the same even with CSS, CSS gets updated all the time and those updates are rolled out in an uneven manner. <br />
<br />
      While updates are being released all the time, we can’t expect the browsers which render the applications to be up to date with all those updates, to be honest most of the browsers are never up to date with the changes made with  technologies.<br />
<br />
      There is also the manner in which new features get into browsers in the first place. It is not the case that new features for CSS are designed by the CSS Working Group, and a complete spec handed down to browser vendors with an instruction to implement it. Quite often it is only when an experimental implementation happens, that all the finer details of the specification can be worked out. <br />
<br />
      Therefore, feature development is an iterative process and requires that browsers implement these specifications in development. While implementation happens these days most often behind a flag in the browser or available only in a Nightly or preview version, once a browser has a complete feature, it is likely to switch it on for everyone even if no other browser yet has support.<br />
<br />
      CSS is just not about using a bunch of tags and adding styles to elements, it is much more than that, principles and techniques like CSS grid, the Flex box, the media queries add more functionality to it. And these also matter when looking for compatibility. <br />
<br />
As a good web developer, we need to ensure that all the styles and CSS we used for the site we are developing are consistent across all browsers.<br />
<br />
      There are <u>three</u> issues that we face with regard to browser support:<br />
<h2><u>1. No support Feature</u></h2><br />
             <p>  If you use a CSS property or value that a browser does not understand, the browser will ignore it. This is the same whether you use a feature that is unsupported, or make up a feature and try to use it. If the browser does not understand that line of CSS, it just skips it and gets on with the next thing it does understand.<br />
               No support feature means that the feature that you have used on the site is not compatible with the present version of the users browser and he is missing some elements. The browser if it does not understand something it simply skips it.</p><br />
<h3>SOLUTIONS:</h3>    There are a couple of solutions that could be used to evade this error. <br />
<h4>1. Testing for Support using Feature Queries</h4><br />
  <p> CSS provides you an opportunity to write styling in a way that will enable you to keep browser compatibility in consideration. There is a feature called the <q><i>@Supports</i></q>. The support is a CSS tag which you can use to check compatibility of the browser before executing a block of code.</p><br />
<p> You use the support tag like a function, in the place of the arguments you can provide the CSS you would want to check the compatibility for and inside the function, you could write the code to execute if the CSS is compatible. To be more clear, the support tag checks the CSS code to see if it is compatible with the current browser version and executes, if it is not compatible it simply skips the block.</p><br />
<p>You can check for multiple conditions at a time using <q>And, Or</q> and you can also use <q>support not</q> to tell the browser what to do if the element is not supported</p<br />
<p>CSS supports come handy when you have an audience that you do not want to disappoint and also when you want the browser to execute code exactly as you want it on different versions of itself </p><br />
<h5> Learn More About Supports </h5><br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/p9fyYspw1YI"> MDN Documentation for CSS Supports </a></br><br />
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports"> Video Tutorial For Supports</a><br />
<h4>2. Using Fallbacks</h4><br />
<p>A very simple way to offer fallbacks is to utilize the fact that browsers ignore CSS that they don’t understand, and the fact that where everything else has equal specificity, source order is taken into account in terms of which CSS is applied to an element.<br />
<br />
You first write your CSS for browsers which do not support the feature. Then test for support of property you want to use, if the browser confirms it has support overwrite the fallback code with your new code.</p><br />
<h2><u>2. Broswer Bugs</u></h2> <br />
<p> What browser bugs means is, the browser is capable of supporting the style or element, but not in a way you expect. It might cause some error or change out the behavior of the element. Browsers are not an exceptions to errors, even they are prone to errors and these errors might cause compatibility issues for any and maybe all of the tags depending on the condition of the browser.</p><br />
<p>The first thing you do when you see something gone awry on your screen is to confirm if it is a browser bug.Perhaps we have used some invalid syntax, or are trying to style malformed HTML. In those cases, the browser will try to do something; however, because you aren’t using the languages as they were designed, each browser might cope in a different way. A quick check that your HTML and CSS is valid is an excellent first step</p><br />
<p> Once you are sure that it is a browser bug, then you can follow the solutions below to get rid of it.</p><br />
<h3>SOLUTIONS:</h3><br />
 <ul><br />
<li> Use a couple of keywords related to that error( a good observation of the screen almost always will show you which component has caused the error) and search on the web and almost always a good stack over flow page will turn up answering your query.</li><br />
<li> You can use this list of resources to search from the most common errors occurring <a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs">FlexBugs</a>,<a href="https://github.com/rachelandrew/gridbugs">GridBugs</a> these are some repos I use, of course there are many others out there</li><br />
<li>If the error you have received is not appearing anywhere, it might be unique, so raise a question on stack overflow with a detailed description, you might get answered and mostly your question would also help other people who faced the same.</li><br />
</ul>  <br />
 <h2><u>3. Partial Compatibility</u></h2><br />
<p>Partial Compatibility means that a certain feature is supported by a browser, but the the sub features provided by that feature may not be supported by every browser.</p><br />
<p>Let's consider an example. properties such as align-items, justify-content, and column-gap are specified to be used in both Grid and Flexbox as well as other layout methods. At the time of writing, however, the gap properties work in Grid Layout in all grid-supporting browsers, and column-gap works in Multicol. All the features proveded by the parent feature are not compatible to the browser. This is the partial compatibility error</p><br />
<h3>SOLUTION:</h3><br />
<p> To evade this error too we use the Support, that is the feature query, but we add an extra keyword <q>selector</q>, the selector specifies that we are using the feature query to find out the support for a sub feature. </p><br />
For example<br />
@supports selector(:has){<br />
  .item {<br />
      /* CSS for support of :has */<br />
  }<br />
}<br />
<h2><u>Checking Compatibility of Web Development Concepts</u></h2><br />
<p>It is always helpful to check the compatibility of the elements you use in web development. It ensures that your hard work is received by majority of users. To ensure this you can use the following resource.</p><br />
<p><a href="https://caniuse.com">Can I Use</a> <br />
This site provides you a complete detailed list of browser compatibility statistics on almost all browsers, it's specialty is that it also shows which versions of the browsers also support it. This site can be used to analyse CSS, JavaScript and HTML element also.</p><br />

                <div>
                    <h1 id="2.17">
                        Topic: 2.17: CSS and Page layout
                    </h1>
                    The CSS enables web developers how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another by using the LAYOUT feature provided by the CSS. <br />
                    <br />
                       The modern layout types like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, floats etc.<br />
               <br />
              >>Normal flow:<br />
                       Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that.<br />
              <br />
              >>Flexbox:<br />
                       Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.<br />
              <br />
              The flex container properties are:<br />
                   *flex-direction<br />
                   *flex-wrap<br />
                   *flex-flow<br />
                   *justify-content<br />
                   *align-items<br />
                   *align-content<br />
                      <br />
              >>Grids:<br />
                        CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.<br />
                        The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.<br />
                 >>Grid elements:<br />
              A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.<br />
                 The Grid layout properties are:<br />
                *Display<br />
                *Grid columns<br />
                *Grid rows<br />
                *Grid gap<br />
                *Grid line<br />
                <br />
              >>Floats:<br />
                         Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. <br />
              <br />
              >>Positioning:<br />
                          Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport.<br />
              <br />
              >>Multiple-column layout:<br />
                           The multiple-column layout specification gives you a method of laying content out in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.<br />
                     <br />
                       Among all these, Grid systems are a very common feature used in CSS layouts, and before CSS Grid Layout they tended to be implemented using floats or other layout features. You imagine your layout as a set number of columns (e.g. 4, 6, or 12), and then fit your content columns inside these imaginary columns.<br />

                    </h1>
                    CSS Selectors:<br />
<br />
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.<br />
<br />
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:<br />
<br />
.Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)<br />
.Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)<br />
.Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)<br />
.Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)<br />
.Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)<br />
<br />
<br />
=>The CSS element Selector<br />
:<br />
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: <br />
<br />
p {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: red;<br />
}<br />
<br />
=>The CSS id Selector:<br />
<br />
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.<br />
<br />
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!<br />
<br />
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": <br />
<br />
#para1 {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: red;<br />
}<br />
<br />
=>The CSS class Selector:<br />
<br />
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.<br />
<br />
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: <br />
<br />
.center {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: red;<br />
}<br />
<br />
=>The CSS Universal Selector:<br />
<br />
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: <br />
<br />
* {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: blue;<br />
}<br />
<br />
=>The CSS Grouping Selector:<br />
<br />
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.<br />
<br />
Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):<br />
<br />
h1 {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: red;<br />
}<br />
<br />
h2 {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: red;<br />
}<br />
<br />
p {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: red;<br />
}<br />
It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.<br />
<br />
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: <br />
<br />
h1, h2, p {<br />
  text-align: center;<br />
  color: red;<br />
}<br />

                    </h1>
  <b><u>Introduction:-</b></u><br />
             JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.<br />
<br />
<b><u> Features of javascript:-</b></u><br />
<br />
 There are following features of JavaScript:-<br />
<br />
1. All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.<br />
2. It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.<br />
3. It is a case-sensitive language.<br />
4. JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.<br />
5. It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.<br />
6. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Application of JavaScript:-</b></u><br />
<br />
JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:<br />
->Client-side validation,<br />
->Dynamic drop-down menus,<br />
->Displaying date and time,<br />
->Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert <br />
  dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),<br />
  Displaying clocks etc.<br />
<br />
<br />

                        Topic: 3.2: Variables
                    </h1>
                    The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:<br />
<br />
1. Fixed values<br />
2. Variable values<br />
<br />
->Variable values are called Variables  <br />
  <br />
            <b>A JavaScript variable</b> is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.<br />
<br />
<b>JavaScript Identifiers</b><br />
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.<br />
<br />
These unique names are called identifiers.<br />
<br />
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).<br />
<br />
<b>There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers):-</b><br />
1. Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.<br />
2. After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.<br />
3. JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.<br />
<br />
<b>Correct JavaScript variables</b><br />
var  x  =  10 ;  <br />
var _value="sonoo";  <br />
<b>Incorrect JavaScript variables</b><br />
var   123 = 30 ;  <br />
var * aa = 320 ;  <br />
<br />
<b>Example of JavaScript variable</b><br />
Let’s see a simple example of JavaScript variable.<br />
Input:-<br />
var  x  =  10 ;  <br />
var  y  =  20 ;  <br />
var  z = x + y;  <br />
document.write(z);  <br />
Output:-<br />
30<br />
<br />
<h5><b><u>types of javascript variables</b></u></h5><br />
<br />
<b>1.javascript localvariable:-</b><br />
<br />
                  A<b>JavaScript local variable</b> is declared inside block or function. It is accessible within the function or block only. For example:-<br />
<br />
function abc(){  <br />
var x=10;//local variable  <br />
} <br />
<br />
<b>2.javascript globalvariable</b><br />
             <br />
                      A <b>JavaScript global variable</b> is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global variable. For example:<br />
<br />
var data=200;//gloabal variable  <br />
function a(){  <br />
document.writeln(data);  <br />
}  <br />
function b(){  <br />
document.writeln(data);  <br />
}  <br />
a();//calling JavaScript function  <br />
b();  <br />
<br />

<br />
->Fixed values are called Literals<br />

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:<br />
<br />
<b>1. Numbers are written with or without decimals</b><br />
Ex:-<br />
55.5<br />
300<br />
<br />
<br />

2. "," 	:-Comma Operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated as single statement.<br />
<br />
3. delete :-Delete Operator deletes a property from the object.<br />
<br />
4. instanceof	:-checks if the object is an instance of given type<br />
5.new  :-creates an instance (object).<br />
<br />
6.typeof:-checks the type of object.<br />
<br />
7.void:-it discards the expression's return value.<br />

                    </h1>
                    ControlStructure: <br />
When programmers are required to design the logic of a program, they typically use control structures to describe the tasks a program is to perform. A control structure, also known as a construct, depicts the logical order of program instructions. Three basic control structures are sequence, selection, and repetition.<br />
<br />
1.)Sequence Control Structure:<br />
A sequence control structure shows one or more actions following each other in order. Actions include inputs, processes, and outputs. All actions must be executed; that is, none can be skipped. Examples of actions are reading a record, calculating averages or totals, and printing totals.<br />
<br />
2.)Selection Control Structure:<br />
A selection control structure tells the program which action to take, based on a certain condition. Two common types of selection control structures are the if-then-else and the case.<br />
<br />
3.)Repetition Control Structure:<br />
The repetition control structure enables a program to perform one or more actions repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met. Many programmers refer to this construct as a loop. Two forms of the repetition control structure are the do-while and do-until.<br />
<br />

                        Topic: 3.6: Conditional statements
                    </h1>
                    Conditional statements:<br />
if<br />
The if statement is straightforward — if the given expression is true, the statement or statements will be executed. Otherwise, they are skipped.<br />
<br />
if (a === b) {<br />
  document.body.innerHTML += "a equals b";<br />
}<br />
The if statement may also consist of multiple parts, incorporating else and else if sections. These keywords are part of the if statement, and identify the code blocks that are executed, if the preceding condition is false.<br />
<br />
if (a === b) {<br />
  document.body.innerHTML += "a equals b";<br />
} else if (a === c) {<br />
  document.body.innerHTML += "a equals c";<br />
} else {<br />
  document.body.innerHTML += "a does not equal either b or c";<br />
}<br />
while<br />
The while statement executes a given statement as long as a given expression is true. For example, the code block below will increase the variable c to 10:<br />
<br />
while (c < 10) {<br />
  c += 1;<br />
  // …<br />
}<br />
This control loop also recognizes the break and continue keywords. The break keyword causes the immediate termination of the loop, allowing for the loop to terminate from anywhere within the while block.<br />
<br />
The continue keyword finishes the current iteration of the while block or statement, and checks the condition to see, if it is true. If it is true, the loop commences again.<br />
<br />
do … while<br />
The do … while statement executes a given statement as long as a given expression is true - however, unlike the while statement, this control structure will always execute the statement or block at least once. For example, the code block below will increase the variable c to 10:<br />
<br />
do {<br />
  c += 1;<br />
} while (c < 10);<br />
As with while, break and continue are both recognized and operate in the same manner. In other words, break exits the loop, and continue checks the condition before attempting to restart the loop.<br />
<br />
for<br />
The for statement allows greater control over the condition of iteration. While it has a conditional statement, it also allows a pre-loop statement, and post-loop increment without affecting the condition. The initial expression is executed once, and the conditional is always checked at the beginning of each loop. At the end of the loop, the increment statement executes before the condition is checked once again. The syntax is:<br />
<br />
for (<initial expression>;<condition>;<final expression>)<br />
<br />
The for statement is usually used for integer counters:<br />
<br />
var c;<br />
for (c = 0; c < 10; c += 1) {<br />
  // …<br />
}<br />
While the increment statement is normally used to increase a variable by one per loop iteration, it can contain any statement, such as one that decreases the counter.<br />
<br />
break and continue are both recognized. The continue statement will still execute the increment statement before the condition is checked.<br />
<br />
A second version of this loop is the for .. in statement that has following form:<br />
<br />
for (element in object) {<br />
  // …<br />
}<br />
The order of object elements accessed by this version is arbitrary. For instance, this structure can be used to loop through all the properties of an object instance. It should not be used when the object is of Array type<br />
<br />
switch<br />
The switch statement evaluates an expression, and determines flow control based on the result of the expression:<br />
<br />
switch(i) {<br />
case 1:<br />
  // …<br />
  break;<br />
case 2:<br />
  // …<br />
  break;<br />
default:<br />
  // …<br />
  break;<br />
}<br />
When i gets evaluated, its value is checked against each of the case labels. These case labels appear in the switch statement and, if the value for the case matches i, continues the execution at that point. If none of the case labels match, execution continues at the default label (or skips the switch statement entirely, if none is present.)<br />
<br />
Case labels may only have constants as part of their condition.<br />
<br />
The break keyword exits the switch statement, and appears at the end of each case in order to prevent undesired code from executing. While the break keyword may be omitted (for example, you want a block of code executed for multiple cases), it may be considered bad practice doing so.<br />
<br />
The continue keyword does not apply to switch statements.<br />
<br />
Omitting the break can be used to test for more than one value at a time:<br />
<br />
switch(i) {<br />
case 1:<br />
case 2:<br />
case 3:<br />
  // …<br />
  break;<br />
case 4:<br />
  // …<br />
  break;<br />
default:<br />
  // …<br />
  break;<br />
}<br />
In this case the program will run the same code in case i equals 1, 2 or 3.<br />
<br />
with<br />
The with statement is used to extend the scope chain for a block[1] and has the following syntax:<br />
<br />
with (expression) {<br />
  // statement<br />
}<br />
Pros<br />
The with statement can help to<br />
<br />
reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference, and<br />
relieve the interpreter of parsing repeated object references.<br />
However, in many cases, this can be achieved by using a temporary variable to store a reference to the desired object.<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
The with statement forces the specified object to be searched first for all name lookups. Therefore<br />
<br />
all identifiers that aren't members of the specified object will be found more slowly in a 'with' block and should only be used to encompass code blocks that access members of the object.<br />
with makes it difficult for a human or a machine to find out which object was meant by searching the scope chain.<br />
Used with something else than a plain object, with may not be forward-compatible.<br />
Therefore, the use of the with statement is not recommended, as it may be the source of confusing bugs and compatibility issues.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
var area;<br />
var r = 10;<br />
<br />
with (Math) {<br />
  a = PI*r*r;       // == a = Math.PI*r*r<br />
  x = r*cos(PI);    // == a = r*Math.cos(Math.PI);<br />
  y = r*sin(PI/2);  // == a = r*Math.sin(Math.PI/2);<br />
}<br />

                    </h1>
                    JavaScript Arrays<br />
JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.<br />
<br />
Array:<br />
<br />
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.<br />
<br />
If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:<br />
<br />
An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.<br />
<br />
Creating an Array:<br />
<br />
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.<br />
<br />
Syntax:<br />
<br />
var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];      <br />
Example<br />
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];<br />
Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:<br />
<br />
Array:<br />
<br />
var person = ["John", "Doe", 46];<br />
Objects use names to access its "members". In this example, person.firstName returns John:<br />
<br />
Object:<br />
<br />
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};<br />
Array Elements Can Be Objects<br />
JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.<br />
<br />
Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.<br />
<br />
You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:<br />
<br />
myArray[0] = Date.now;<br />
myArray[1] = myFunction;<br />
myArray[2] = myCars;<br />
Array Properties and Methods<br />
The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods:<br />

                        Topic: 3.8: Functions
                    </h1>
                    JavaScript Functions<br />
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.<br />
<br />
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).<br />
<br />
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().<br />
<br />
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).<br />
<br />
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:<br />
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)<br />
<br />
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}<br />
<br />
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.<br />
<br />
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.<br />
<br />
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.<br />
<br />
A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.<br />
<br />
Function Invocation<br />
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:<br />
<br />
Function Return<br />
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.<br />
<br />
If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.<br />
<br />
Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":<br />
<br />
Example<br />
Calculate the product of two numbers, and return the result:<br />
<br />
var x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x<br />
<br />
function myFunction(a, b) {<br />
  return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b<br />
}<br />
<br />
Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.<br />
<br />
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius;<br />
Functions Used as Variable Values<br />
Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.<br />
<br />
Local Variabls<br />
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.<br />
<br />
Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.<br />

                    </h1>
                    Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).<br />
<br />
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.<br />
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.<br />
Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.<br />
An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.<br />
<br />
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.<br />
<br />
Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)<br />
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)<br />
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)<br />
Dates are always objects<br />
Maths are always objects<br />
Regular expressions are always objects<br />
Arrays are always objects<br />
Functions are always objects<br />
Objects are always objects<br />
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.<br />
<br />
Objects are Variables<br />
JavaScript variables can contain single values:<br />
<br />
Example<br />
var person = "John Doe";<br />
<br />
Creating a JavaScript Object<br />
With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.<br />
<br />
There are different ways to create new objects:<br />
<br />
Define and create a single object, using an object literal.<br />
Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.<br />
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed types<br />
<br />
Using the JavaScript Keyword new<br />
The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:<br />
<br />
JavaScript Objects are Mutable<br />
Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.<br />
<br />
If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:

                    </h1>
                    Predefined Objects – They include Array, Boolean, Date, Function, Math, Number, RegExp, and String.<br />
<br />
Array Object – JavaScript does not have an explicit array data type. However, use the predefined Array object and its methods to work with arrays in applications. The Array object has methods for manipulating arrays in various ways, such as joining, reversing, sorting them. It has a property for determining the array length and other properties for use with regular expressions.<br />
<br />
Boolean Object – Use the predefined Boolean object to convert a non-boolean value to a boolean value. Use the Boolean object any place JavaScript expects a primitive boolean value. JavaScript returns the primitive value of the Boolean object by automatically invoking the valueOf method.<br />
<br />
Date Object – JavaScript does not have a date data type. Use the Date object and its methods to work with dates and times in applications. The Date object has a large number of methods for setting, getting, and manipulating dates. It does not have any properties.<br />
<br />
Function Object – The predefined Function object specifies a string of JavaScript code to be compiled as a function.<br />
<br />
Number Object – The Number object has properties for numerical constants, such as maximum value, not-a-number, and infinity. The values of these properties cannot be changed.<br />
<br />
RegExp Object – The RegExp object enables working with regular expressions.<br />
<br />
String Object – JavaScript does not have a string data type. However, use the String object and its methods to work with strings in applications. The String object has a large number of methods for manipulating strings.

                    </h1>
                    Navigator Object Hierarchy<br />
<br />
When loading a document in Navigator, it creates a number of JavaScript objects with property values based on the HTML document and other information. They exist in a hierarchy that reflects the structure of the HTML page. This hierarchy is known as instance hierarchy, because it concerns specific instances of objects rather than object classes.<br />
<br />
In this hierarchy, the object's "descendants" are properties of the object. For example, a form named myform is an object as well as a property of document, and it is referred as document.myform.<br />
<br />
Every page has the following objects:<br />
<br />
navigator: has properties for the version of Navigator being used, the MIME types supported and the plug-ins installed in the client.<br />
<br />
window: has properties that apply to the whole window.<br />
<br />
document: contains properties based on the content of the document, such as title, background color, links and forms.<br />
<br />
location: has properties based on the current URL.<br />
<br />
history: contains properties representing URLs the client has previously requested.<br />
<br />
For example, to refer the value property of a text field named mytext1 in myform, the following syntax can be used:<br />
<br />
document.myform.mytext1.value

                    Accessing Object Members<br />
<br />
Object members(properties or methods) can be accessed using the :<br />
<br />
1.dot notation :<br />
<br />
(objectName.memberName)<br />
<br />
let school = { <br />
<br />
    name : "Vivekanada", <br />
<br />
    location : "Delhi", <br />
<br />
    established : 1971, <br />
<br />
    20 : 1000, <br />
<br />
    displayinfo : function() { <br />
<br />
        console.log(`${school.name} was established  <br />
<br />
          in ${school.established} at ${school.location}`); <br />
<br />
    } <br />
<br />
  <br />
} <br />
<br />
  <br />
console.log(school.name); <br />
<br />
  <br />
console.log(school.established)<br />
<br />
2.Bracket Notation :<br />
<br />
 objectName["memberName"]<br />
<br />
let school = { <br />
<br />
    name : "Vivekanada School", <br />
<br />
    location : "Delhi", <br />
<br />
    established : 1995, <br />
<br />
    20 : 1000, <br />
<br />
    displayinfo : function() { <br />
<br />
        document.write(`${school.name} was established  <br />
<br />
          in ${school.established} at ${school.location}`); <br />
<br />
    } <br />
} <br />
<br />
  <br />
// Output : Vivekanada School <br />
<br />
console.log(school['name']);  <br />
<br />
  <br />
// Output: 1000 <br />
<br />
console.log(school['20']);  <br />
<br />
Unlike the dot notation, the bracket keyword works with any string combination, including, but not limited to multi-word strings.<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
somePerson.first name // invalid<br />
    somePerson["first name"] // <br />
valid<br />
<br />
Unlike the dot notation, the bracket notation can also contain names which are results of any expressions variables whose values are computed at run-time.<br />
<br />
For instance :<br />
<br />
let key = "first name" somePerson[key] = "Name Surname"<br />
<br />
Similar operations are not possible while using the dot notation.

THE EVENT OBJECT : <br />
<br />
The Event object is created automatically whenever an event occurs. There are a number of properties associated with the Event object that can be queried to provide additional information about the event: <br />
<br />
Event.data :<br />
<br />
Used by the onDragDrop event. Returns an array of URLs of dropped objects. <br />
<br />
Event.height :<br />
<br />
Stores the height of the window or frame containing the object connected with the event. <br />
<br />
Event.modifiers :<br />
<br />
Returns a string listing any modifier keys that were held down during a key or mouse event. The modifier key values are: ALT_MASK, CONTROL_MASK, SHIFT_MASK and META_MASK. <br />
<br />
Event.pageX :<br />
Event.pageY :<br />
<br />
These properties hold the X and Y pixel coordinates of the cursor relative to the page, at the time of the event. <br />
<br />
Event.screenX :<br />
Event.screenY :<br />
<br />
These properties hold the X and Y pixel coordinates of the cursor relative to the screen, at the time of the event. <br />
<br />
Event.target :<br />
<br />
Returns a string representing the object that initiated the event. <br />
<br />
Event.type :<br />
<br />
Returns a string representing the type of the event (keypress, click, etc). <br />
<br />
Event.which :<br />
<br />
Returns a number representing the mouse button that was pressed (1=left, 2=middle, 3=right) or the ASCII code of the key that was pressed. <br />
<br />
Event.width :<br />
<br />
Stores the width of the window or frame containing the object connected with the event. <br />
<br />
Event.x :<br />
Event.y :<br />
<br />
These properties hold the X and Y pixel coordinates of the cursor relative to the layer connected with the event or, for the onResize event, the width and height of the object after it was resized. (You can also use event.layerX and event.layerY, which do the same thing.) <br />

EVENT HANDLERS IN HTML : <br />
<br />
To allow you to run your bits of code when these events occur, JavaScript provides us with event handlers. All the event handlers in JavaScript start with the word on, and each event handler deals with a certain type of event. Here’s a list of all the event handlers in JavaScript, along with the objects they apply to and the events that trigger them: <br />
<br />
Event handler                  Applies to:                              Triggered when: <br />
<br />
onAbort                         Image                                   The loading of the image is cancelled. <br />
<br />
onBlur                          Button, Checkbox, FileUpload, Layer,     The object in question loses focus (e.g. by clicking <br />
                                Password, Radio, Reset, Select, Submit,  outside it or pressing the TAB key).<br />

<br />
Using an event handler : <br />
<br />
To use an event handler, you usually place the event handler name within the HTML tag of the object you want to work with, followed by ="SomeJavaScriptCode", where SomeJavaScriptCode is the JavaScript you would like to execute when the event occurs. <br />
<br />
For example: <br />
<br />
<input type="submit" name="clickme"value="Click Me!" onclick="alert('Thank You!')"/> <br />
<br />
NOTE: Although the original JavaScript event handler name contains capital letters ("onClick"), you should use all lowercase in the HTML itself ("onclick") if you want your markup to follow the XHTML specification (which we do!). All element names and attributes must be lowercase in XHTML. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Some common event handlers : <br />
<br />
In this section, we’ll look at a few of the more commonly used event handlers, and examine how they can be used. <br />
<br />
OnChange : <br />
<br />
               onChange is commonly used to validate form fields (see my tutorial on Form validation with JavaScript) or to otherwise perform an action when a form field’s value has been altered by the user. The event handler is triggered when the user changes the field then clicks outside the field or uses the TAB key (i.e. the object loses focus). <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
This example code ensures that you type in both your first and your last names. It will bring up an alert box and refocus the text box field if you only type one word into the text box. <br />
<br />
Please enter your name: <input type="text" <br />
<br />
name="your_name" onchange="validateField(this)"/> <br />
<br />
<xmp><scrip type="text/javascript"> <br />
<br />
function validateField ( fieldname )  <br />
<br />
 {     <br />
<br />
     if ( ( fieldname.value ) && ( ! fieldname.value.match ( " " ) ) )     <br />
<br />
           {        <br />
<br />
               alert ( "Please enter your first and last names!" );  <br />
<br />
               fieldname.focus ( );  <br />
<br />
             } <br />
<br />
   } <br />
<br />
  </script> </xmp><br />
<br />
OnClick: <br />
<br />
              The onClick handler is executed when the user clicks with the mouse on the object in question. Because you can use it on many types of objects, from buttons through to checkboxes through to links, it’s a great way to create interactive Web pages based on JavaScript. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
In this example, an alert box is displayed when you click on the link below. <br />
<br />
<xmp><a href="#" onclick="alert('Thanks!')">Click Me!</a> <br /></xmp>
<br />
OnFocus: <br />
<br />
            onFocus is executed whenever the specified object gains focus. This usually happens when the user clicks on the object with the mouse button, or moves to the object using the TAB key. onFocus can be used on most form elements. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
This example text box contains the prompt “Please enter your email address” that is cleared once the text box has focus. <br />
<br />
<input type="text" name="email_address" <br />
<br />
size="40" value="Please enter your email address" <br />
<br />
onfocus="this.value=''"/> <br />
<br />
OnKeyPress: <br />
<br />
               You can use onKeyPress to determine when a key on the keyboard has been pressed. This is useful for allowing keyboard shortcuts in your forms and for providing interactivity and games. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
This example uses the onKeyPress event handler for the Window object to determine when a key was pressed. In addition, it uses the which property of the Event object to determine the ASCII code of the key that was pressed, and then displays the pressed key in a text box. If event.which is undefined it uses event.keyCode instead (Internet Explorer uses event.keyCode instead of event.which). <br />
<br />
 <br />
<html> <br />
<br />
<body onkeypress = "show_key(event.which)"> <br />
<br />
<form method="post" name="my_form"> <br />
<br />
The key you pressed was: <br />
<br />
<input type="text" name="key_display" size="2"/> <br />
<br />
</form> <br />
<br />
<xmp><scrip type="text/javascript"> <br />
<br />
function show_key ( the_key ) <br />
<br />
{     <br />
<br />
   if ( ! the_key )     <br />
<br />
       { <br />
<br />
            the_key = event.keyCode;     <br />
<br />
        } <br />
<br />
   document.my_form.key_display.value    = <br />
<br />
   String.fromCharCode ( the_key ); <br />
<br />
} <br />
<br />
</script> </xmp><br />
<br />
</body> <br />
<br />
</html> <br />
<br />
OnLoad: <br />
<br />
         The onLoad event handler is triggered when the page has finished loading. Common uses of onLoad include the dreaded pop-up advertisement windows, and to start other actions such as animations or timers once the whole page has finished loading. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
This simple example displays an alert box when the page has finished loading: <br />
<br />
<xmp><html> <br />
<br />
<body onload = "alert('Thanks for visiting my page!')"> <br />
<br /></xmp>
My Page <br />
<br />
</body> <br />
<br />
</html> <br />
<br />
onMouseOut, onMouseOver: <br />
<br />
                                  The classic use of these two event handlers is for JavaScript rollover images (images, such as buttons, that change when you move your mouse over them). <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
Here’s a simple example that alters the value of a text box depending on whether the mouse pointer is over a link or not. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<form> <br />
<br />
<input type="text" id="status" value="Not over the link"/> <br />
<br />
<br> <br />
<br />
<a href="" onmouseover="document.getElementById('status').value='Over the link'"onmouseout="document.getElementById('status').value='Not over the link'">Movethe mouse over me!</a> <br />
<br />
</form> <br />
<br />
OnSubmit: <br />
<br />
              The onSubmit event handler, which works only with the Form object, is commonly used to validate the form before it’s sent to the server. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
This example asks you to confirm whether you want to submit the form or not when you click on the button. It returns true to the event handler if the form is to be submiited, and false if the submission is to be cancelled. <br />
<br />
<form onsubmit="return confirm('Are You Sure?')" action=""> <br />
<br />
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"/> <br />
<br />
</form> <br />
 <br />

                    Multiple Windows and Frames <br />
<br />
Most of the client-side JavaScript examples we've seen so far have involved only a single window or frame. In the real world, JavaScript applications often involve multiple windows or frames. Recall that frames within a window are represented by Window objects; JavaScript makes little distinction between windows and frames. In the most interesting applications, there is JavaScript code that runs independently in each of several windows. The next section explains how the JavaScript code in each window can interact and cooperate with each of the other windows and with the scripts running in each of those windows. <br />
1. Relationships Between Frames <br />
We've already seen that the open( ) method of the Window object returns a new Window object representing the newly created window. We've also seen that this new window has an opener property that refers back to the original window. In this way, the two windows can refer to each other, and each can read properties and invoke methods of the other. The same thing is possible with frames. Any frame in a window can refer to any other frame through the use of the frames, parent, and top properties of the Window object. Every window has a frames property. This property refers to an array of Window objects, each of which represents a frame contained within the window. (If a window does not have any frames, the frames[] array is empty and frames.length is zero.) Thus, a window (or frame) can refer to its first subframe as frames[0], its second subframe as frames[1], and so on. Similarly, JavaScript code running in a window can refer to the third subframe of its second frame like this:<br />
   frames[1].frames[2] <br />
Every window also has a parent property, which refers to the Window object in which it is contained. Thus, the first frame within a window might refer to its sibling frame (the second frame within the window) like this: <br />
    parent.frames[1]<br />
 If a window is a top-level window and not a frame, parent simply refers to the window itself: <br />
parent == self; // For any top-level window <br />
<br />
If a frame is contained within another frame that is contained within a top-level window, that frame can refer to the top-level window as parent.parent. The top property is a general-case shortcut, however: no matter how deeply a frame is nested, its top property refers to the top-level containing window. If a Window object represents a top-level window, top simply refers to that window itself. For frames that are direct children of a top-level window, the top property is the same as the parent property. Frames are typically created with and tags. In HTML 4, however, as implemented in IE 4 and later and Netscape 6 and later, the iframe tag can also be used to create an "inline frame" within a document. As far as JavaScript is concerned, frames created with iframe are the same as frames created with and . Everything discussed here applies to both kinds of frames. <br />
<br />
2.Window and Frame Names <br />
      The second, optional argument to the open( ) method discussed earlier is a name for the newly created window. When you create a frame with the HTML tag, you can specify a name with the name attribute. An important reason to specify names for windows and frames is that those names can be used as the value of the target attribute of the <a>, <map>and <form>tags. This value tells the browser where you want to display the results of activating a link, clicking on an image map, or submitting a form. <br />
For example, if you have two windows, one named table_of_contents and the other mainwin, you might have HTML like the following in the table_of_contents window:<br />
<a href="Chapter01.html" target="mainwin"><br />
Chapter1 ,Introduction <br />
</a><br />
The browser loads the specified URL when the user clicks on this hyperlink, but instead of displaying the URL in the same window as the link, it displays it in the window named mainwin. If there is no window with the name mainwin, clicking the link creates a new window with that name and loads the specified URL into it. The target and name attributes are part of HTML and operate without the intervention of JavaScript, but there are also JavaScript-related reasons to give names to your frames. We've seen that every Window object has a frames[] array that contains references to each of its frames. This array contains all the frames in a window (or frame), whether or not they have names. If a frame is given a name, however, a reference to that frame is also stored in a new property of the parent Window object. The name of that new property is the same as the name of the frame. Therefore, you might create a frame with HTML like this: Now you can refer to that frame from another, sibling frame with: parent.table_of_contents This makes your code easier to read and understand than using (and relying on) a hardcoded array index, as you'd have to do with an unnamed frame: parent.frames[1] The name property of any Window object contains the name of that window. In JavaScript 1.0, this property is read-only. In JavaScript 1.1 and later, however, you can set this property, thereby changing the name of a window or a frame. One common reason to do this is to set the name of the initial browser window. When a browser starts up, the initial window has no name, so it cannot be used with the target attribute. If you set the name property of the window, however, you can then use that name in target attributes. <br />
<br />
3. JavaScript in Interacting Windows:<br />
      The Window object serves as the global object for client-side JavaScript code, and the window serves as the execution context for all JavaScript code it contains. This holds true for frames as well: every frame is an independent JavaScript execution context. Because every Window object is its own global object, each window defines its own namespace and its own set of global variables. When viewed from the perspective of multiple frames or windows, global variables do not seem all that global, after all! Although each window and frame defines an independent JavaScript execution context, this does not mean that JavaScript code running in one window is isolated from code running in other windows. Code running in one frame has a different Window object at the top of its scope chain than code running in another frame. However, the code from both frames is executed by the same JavaScript interpreter, in the same JavaScript environment. As we've seen, one frame can refer to any other frame using the frames, parent, and top properties. So, although JavaScript code in different frames is executed with different scope chains, the code in one frame can still refer to and use the variables and functions defined by code in another frame. For example, suppose code in frame A defines a variable i: <br />
var i = 3; <br />
That variable is nothing more than a property of the global object -- a property of the Window object. Code in frame A could refer to the variable explicitly as such a property with either of these two expressions:<br />
 window.i <br />
 self.i <br />
Now suppose that frame A has a sibling frame B that wants to set the value of the variable i defined by the code in frame A. If frame B just sets a variable i, it merely succeeds in creating a new property of its own Window object. So instead, it must explicitly refer to the property i in its sibling frame with code like this:<br />
  parent.frames[0].i = 4; Recall that the function keyword that defines functions declares a variable just like the var keyword does. If JavaScript code in frame A declares a function f, that function is defined only within frame A. Code in frame A can invoke f like this: <br />
   f( );<br />
 Code in frame B, however, must refer to f as a property of the Window object of frame <br />
   A: parent.frames[0].f( ); <br />
If the code in frame B needs to use this function frequently, it might assign the function to a variable of frame B so that it can more conveniently refer to the function:<br />
 var f = parent.frames[0].f; <br />
Now code in frame B can invoke the function as f( ), just as code in frame A does. When you share functions between frames or windows like this, it is very important to keep the rules of lexical scoping in mind. A function is executed in the scope in which it was defined, not in the scope from which it is invoked. <br>Thus, to continue with the previous example, if the function f refers to global variables, these variables are looked up as properties of frame A, even when the function is invoked from frame B. If you don't pay careful attention to this, you can end up with programs that behave in unexpected and confusing ways. For example, suppose you define the following function in the section of a multiframe document, with the idea that it will help with debugging: function debug(msg) { alert("Debugging message from frame: " + name + "\n" + msg); } <br />
<br />
The JavaScript code in each of your frames can refer to this function as top.debug( ). Whenever this function is invoked, however, it looks up the variable name in the context of the top-level window in which the function is defined, rather than the context of the frame from which it is invoked. Thus, the debugging messages always carry the name of the top-level window, rather than the name of the frame that sent the message, as was intended. Remember that constructors are also functions, so when you define a class of objects with a constructor function and an associated prototype object, that class is defined only for a single window. Consider the following multiframed HTML document: JavaScript code in the files frame1.html and frame2.html cannot create a Complex object with an expression like this:<br />
 var c = new Complex(1,2); // Won't work from either frame <br />
<br />
Instead, code in these files must explicitly refer to the constructor function: <br />
var c = new top.Complex(3,4); Alternatively, code in either frame can define its own variable to refer more conveniently to the constructor function: <br />
var Complex = top.Complex; var c = new Complex(1,2);<br />
 Unlike user-defined constructors, predefined constructors are automatically predefined in all windows. <br>Note, however, that each window has an independent copy of the constructor and an independent copy of the constructor's prototype object. <br>For example, each window has its own copy of the String( ) constructor and the String.prototype object. <br>So, if you write a new method for manipulating JavaScript strings and then make it a method of the String class by assigning it to the String.<br>prototype object in the current window, all strings in that window can use the new method.<br> However, the new method is not accessible to strings defined in other windows. Note that it does not matter which window holds a reference to the string; only the window in which the string was actually created matters. <br />

                    <br />
                    The HTML <form> Elements<br />
                    The HTML <form> element can contain one or more of the following form elements:<br />
                    <br />
                    <input><br />
                    <label><br />
                    <select><br />
                    <textarea><br />
                    <button><br />
                    <fieldset><br />
                    <legend><br />
                    <datalist><br />
                    <output><br />
                    <option><br />
                    <optgroup><br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The <input> Element<br />
                    One of the most used form element is the <input> element.<br />
                    <br />
                    The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.<br />
                    <br />
                    The <label> Element<br />
                    The <label> element defines a label for several form elements.<br />
                    <br />
                    The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.<br />
                    <br />
                    The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.<br />
                    <br />
                    The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.<br />
                    <br />
                    The <select> Element<br />
                    The <select> element defines a drop-down list:<br />
                    The <option> elements defines an option that can be selected.<br />
                    <br />
                    By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected.<br />
                    <br />
                    To define a pre-selected option, add the selected attribute to the option:<br />
                    <br />
                    Visible Values:<br />
                    Use the size attribute to specify the number of visible values:<br />
                    <br />
                    Allow Multiple Selections:<br />
                    Use the multiple attribute to allow the user to select more than one value:<br />
                    <br />
                    The <textarea> Element<br />
                    The <textarea> element defines a multi-line input field (a text area):<br />
                    The rows attribute specifies the visible number of lines in a text area.<br />
                    <br />
                    The cols attribute specifies the visible width of a text area.<br />
                    <br />
                    This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:<br />
                    <br />
                    The <button> Element<br />
                    The <button> element defines a clickable button:<br />
                    <br />
                    The <fieldset> and <legend> Elements<br />
                    The <fieldset> element is used to group related data in a form.<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The <datalist> Element<br />
                    The <datalist> element specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element.<br />
                    <br />
                    Users will see a drop-down list of the pre-defined options as they input data.<br />
                    <br />
                    The list attribute of the <input> element, must refer to the id attribute of the <datalist> element.<br />
                    <br />
                    The <output> Element<br />
                    The <output> element represents the result of a calculation (like one performed by a script).<br />
                    The <legend> element defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.<br />
                    <br />

                    Advanced JavaScript Backend Basics</h1><br />
<h2>Getting Started with JavaScript Backend Basics</h2><br />
<p><br />
The following article is a continuation to my previous article. In this article, we will dive deep into some of the advanced JavaScript concepts that are being used widely in the industry.<br />
<br />
“==” vs “===”<br />
<br />
The “==” coerces the types of the input that is it forces the variable to be the same and then checks their equality.<br />
The “===” actually requires equivalent types to give a true output. Basically, the “===” is more widely used and the “==” should only be used when we really know the type equivalence of the inputs. Below is the table that clearly defines for what values they both will send TRUE or FALSE.<br />

<br><br />
<h1>JavaScript false values</h1><br />
<br />
<b>The following values when converted into boolean are treated as FALSE values:</b><br />
<ul><br />
<li>0 – The number zero is always false</li><br />
<li>undefined – Any value if primitively undefined is treated as false.</li><br />
<li>null – Primitive null values are always false</li><br />
<li>+0 , -0 , NaN(not a number) – positive/negative zero or a value which is Not a number is considered false.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<h2>JavaScript Truth Values</h2><br />
<b>The following values when converted into boolean are treated as TRUE values:</b><br />
<ul><br />
<li>{ } – The empty object</li><br />
<li>[ ] – The empty array</li><br />
<li>Everything else that is not false is TRUE.</li><br />
<br />
</ul><br />
<br><br />
<h2>Prototypical inheritance</h2><br />
<p>We know that everything in JavaScript is an object except the primitive types so we require a way to differentiate between objects and the other data types. Here comes the concept of prototypical inheritance.<br />
<br />
</p><br />
<ul><br />
<li>The Non Primitive types (Objects) have a few properties/methods associated with them.<br />
Example:- Array.prototype.push()<br />
String.prototype.toUpperCase()<br />
</li><br />
<li>Each object stores a reference to its prototype and then maybe its prototype also has its prototype that is prototype chaining might be possible.<br />
</li><br />
<li>The prototype/ properties/ methods defined most tightly to the instance have priority</li><br />
</ul><br />
<h3>example code</h3><br />
<p>var arr = []; <br />
arr.test = 'test'; // making a property called test <br />
Array.prototype.test = 'test1' // making a prototype test on the array object <br />
<b>output: test</b><br />
</p><br />
<h2>Prototype Chain</h2><br />
<p>NULL<—Object<—Array<—Instances of Array<br />
The above represents an example of prototype chain followed in case of objects. Like prototype of all instances of array is the object array, the prototype of array object is Object and since in JavaScript everything is an Object and hence its prototype is NULL.<br />
<br />
Some methods or prototypes has a method ‘writable’ which is set to false i.e. they can’t be overwritten</p><br />
<p>var arr = [1, 2, 3]; <br />
arr.length = 'test'; <br />
<b>output:123</b><br />
</p><br />

<br />
Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted with correct information. This was really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server.<br />

𝓓𝓪𝓽𝓪 𝓥𝓪𝓵𝓲𝓭𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷 :: Data validation is the process of ensuring that user input is clean, correct, and useful.<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Typical validation tasks are:<br />
*****************************<br />
1.has the user filled in all required fields?<br />
2.has the user entered a valid date?<br />
3.has the user entered text in a numeric field?<br />
4.Most often, the purpose of data validation is to ensure correct user input.<br />
<br />
* Validation can be defined by many different methods, and deployed in many different ways.<br />
* Server side validation is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server.<br />
* Client side validation is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to a web server.<br />

JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.<br />
<br />
𝓑𝓪𝓼𝓲𝓬 𝓥𝓪𝓵𝓲𝓭𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷 − First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a<br />
loop through each field in the form and check for data.<br />
<br />
𝓓𝓪𝓽𝓪 𝓕𝓸𝓻𝓶𝓪𝓽 𝓥𝓪𝓵𝓲𝓭𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷 − Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.<br />
<br />
𝕰𝖝𝖆𝖒𝖕𝖑𝖊:<br />
We will take an example to understand the process of validation. Here is a simple form in html format.<br />
<br />

First let us see how to do a basic form validation. In the above form, we are calling validate() to validate data when onsubmit event is occurring. The following code shows the implementation of this validate() function.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<script type = "text/javascript">
// Form validation code will come here.<br />
function validate() {
<br />
if( document.myForm.Name.value == "" ) {<br />
alert( "Please provide your name!" );<br />
document.myForm.Name.focus() ;<br />
return false;<br />
}<br />
if( document.myForm.EMail.value == "" ) {<br />
alert( "Please provide your Email!" );<br />
document.myForm.EMail.focus() ;<br />
return false;<br />
}<br />
if( document.myForm.Zip.value == "" || isNaN( document.myForm.Zip.value ) ||
document.myForm.Zip.value.length != 5 ) {
<br />
alert( "Please provide a zip in the format #####." );<br />
document.myForm.Zip.focus() ;<br />
return false;<br />
}<br />
if( document.myForm.Country.value == "-1" ) {<br />
alert( "Please provide your country!" );<br />
return false;<br />
}<br />
return( true );<br />
}
//--><br />
</script><br />

***********************<br />
Now we will see how we can validate our entered form data before submitting it to the web server.<br />
<br />
The following example shows how to validate an entered email address. An email address must contain at least a ‘@’ sign and a dot (.). Also, the ‘@’ must not be the first character of the email address, and the last dot must at least be one character after the ‘@’ sign.<br />
<br />
𝕰𝖝𝖆𝖒𝖕𝖑𝖊:: Try the following code for email validation.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<script type = "text/javascript">
function validateEmail() {<br />
var emailID = document.myForm.EMail.value;<br />
atpos = emailID.indexOf("@");<br />
dotpos = emailID.lastIndexOf(".");
<br />
if (atpos < 1 || ( dotpos - atpos < 2 )) {<br />
alert("Please enter correct email ID")<br />
document.myForm.EMail.focus() ;<br />
return false;<br />
}<br />
return( true );<br />
}<br />
//--><br />

                    </h1>
                    HTML - forms and tables<br />
<br />
HTML forms<br />
For forms, the two main attribute are action and method. action tells the form where to submit the values, and method tells the form how to sumbit the form, the value can be either GET (default) or POST. If you have no idea what I am rambling about, read the rest first, then head over to this article to get it all sorted out.<br />
<br />
What’s more important here is the form elements. These comprises everything that makes up a form. When rendered, the browser will display the form with the different field, depending on the element used.<br />
<br />
Each element will have the tag name and it would correspond to the different fields in the form (eg. ‘email’ and ‘password’ for a login form).<br />
<br />
input (the fundamental one)<br />
This is the one you probably will use the most often. The input element is usually accompanied by a type tag. For those usual text input that you see on most forms, the type value is text, but there are other types of inputs too, like number and date, just to name a few.<br />
<br />
One commonly used input will be the password typed input. Instead of displaying the text, asterixs are used instead to hide the input text from prying eyes.<br />
<br />
Most input type will also have the placeHolder attribute. For modern browsers, the placeHolder value will be displayed when the value of the input is empty.<br />
<br />
input (the special kind)<br />
There are some special kinds of input too. When the input is typed submit, a button will be rendered to submit the form where the input resides in.<br />
<br />
There is also a type hidden for input tags. This tag will not be displayed and is usually used to submit “behind-the-scene” information that users do not need to enter directly.<br />
<br />
textarea (the bigger text input)<br />
For form inputs which are longer (eg. addresses, paragraph of text), there is the textarea element. This element allows for multiline text input. For long input, the textarea is usually used.<br />
<br />
option (the dropdown list)<br />
In some inputs you only want to give your users a few options (their month of birth for example).<br />
<br />
So you make use of option and select to create the dropdown list they can choose from. select is the tag that encloses the different options, in the aptly named tag, option.<br />
<br />
radio buttons (choosing between options)<br />
This is another way of allowing your users to choose from different options. When using radio buttons, all the options are shown, as compared to dropdown lists, where the options are revealed only after a click. Radio buttons are displayed when input are typed radio and are activated when the attribute checked exist for the element.<br />
<br />
checkbox (either on or off)<br />
For this element, it used for fields where there is only two choices (eg. ‘remember password’ for a login form) – selected or not. A checkbox is displayed when an input is typed checkbox.<br />
<br />
HTML5 inputs (specialized pickers)<br />
As I mentioned before, the input tag is the mother of all inputs. In HTML5, there are some new types of inputs that triggers specialized pickers for choosing (eg. colors, dates). There is really too many types to go through throughly here. Visit this article to view the kinds of input available for use.<br />
<br />
input (the expansion pack)<br />
Of course, everything is flexible in frontend development. With sufficient knowledge in styling and javascript, almost everything is possible.<br />
<br />
Libraries such as AnyPicker and jqueryUI extends the form functionality of existing browsers by providing even more specialized pickers for different form fields.<br />
<br />
sample (basic HTML forms)<br />
<form><br />
    <input name="input_text" type="text" placeHolder="text input" /><br />
    <input name="input_hidden" type="hidden" value="not_be_shown" /><br />
    <textarea name="input_textarea" placeHolder="textarea"></textarea><br />
                                                            <br />
                                                            <select name="input_select"><br />
                                                                <option>Option 1</option><br />
                                                                <option>Option 2</option><br />
                                                            </select><br />

                                                        tables (displaying information)<br />
                                                        Most data are displayed in tabular format, it allows the users
                                                        to quickly see the relation between the different entities and
                                                        compare data more efficiently.<br />
                                                        <br />
                                                        The tables in HTML are enclosed in the table tags. Within the
                                                        section, all the information will be formatted by its row and
                                                        column.<br />
                                                        <br />
                                                        tr & td (basic table elements)<br />
                                                        For tables, the most important thing will be the rows and
                                                        columns. In HTML, the rows are represented using the tr tag and
                                                        the column, using td tag.<br />
                                                        <br />
                                                        thead and tbody (table styling)<br />
                                                        When displaying data, the headings are very important. In HTML,
                                                        the headings and the data itself is separated using the thead
                                                        and tbody tags. This way, the headings can be styled separately
                                                        from the rest of the table.<br />
                                                        <br />
                                                        additional data formatting<br />
                                                        Sometimes, tables are not as simple as they seem. In more
                                                        complex arrangement, a single table cell could span over
                                                        multiple rows or columns, and this is where colspan and rowspan

                        Topic: 3.20: DHTML with JavaScript
                    </h1>
                    DHTML JavaScript:</b><br />
                    DHTML stands for Dynamic HTML. Dynamic means that the content of the web page can be customized or
                    changed according to user inputs i.e. a page that is interactive with the user. In earlier times,
                    HTML was used to create a static page. It only defined the structure of the content that was
                    displayed on the page. With the help of CSS, we can beautify the HTML page by changing various
                    properties like text size, background color etc. The HTML and CSS could manage to navigate between
                    static pages but couldn’t do anything else. If 1000 users view a page that had their information for
                    eg. Admit card then there was a problem because 1000 static pages for this application build to
                    work. As the number of users increase, the problem also increases and at some point it becomes
                    impossible to handle this problem.<br />
                    <br />
                    To overcome this problem, DHTML came into existence. DHTML included JavaScript along with HTML and
                    CSS to make the page dynamic. This combo made the web pages dynamic and eliminated this problem of
                    creating static page for each user. To integrate JavaScript into HTML, a Document Object Model(DOM)
                    is made for the HTML document. In DOM, the document is represented as nodes and objects which are
                    accessed by different languages like JavaScript to manipulate the document.<br />

                    The JavaScript document is included in our html page using the html tag. <src> tag is used to
                        specify the source of external JavaScript file.<br />
                        Following are some of the tasks that can be performed with JavaScript:<br />

                            <li>Performing html tasks</li><br />
                            <li>Performing CSS tasks</li><br />

                    INTERNET PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</h1><br />
                    <p>Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task. Programming paradigm
                        is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a
                        method to solve a <br />
                        problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are
                        lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy<br />
                        when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.<br />
                        Apart from varieties of programming language there are lots of paradigms to fulfil each and
                        every demand. They are discussed below:<br />
                        <br><br><br />

                    <p style="font-size:150%"><b>Imperative programming paradigm</b></p><br />
                    <p>It is one of the oldest programming paradigm. It features close relation relation to machine
                        architecture.<br />
                        It works by changing the program state through assignment statements.<br />
                        It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the
                        goal4<br />
                        The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is
                        stored.<br />
                        <br>Imperative programming is divided into three broad categories: Procedural, OOP and parallel
                        processing. <br />
                        These paradigms are as follows:</p><br />
                    <p><b>1.Procedural programming paradigm-</b><br />
                        <br>This paradigm emphasizes on procedure in terms of under lying machine model.<br />
                        There is no difference in between procedural and imperative approach. <br />
                        It has the ability to reuse the code and it was boon at that time when it was in use because of
                        its reusability.</p><br />
                    <p><b>2.Object Oriented Programming paradigm-</b><br />
                        <br>The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for
                        communication.<br />
                        The smallest and basic entity is object and all kind of computation is performed on the objects
                        only. More emphasis is on data rather procedure.<br />
                        It can handle almost all kind of real life problems which are today in scenario.</p><br />
                    <p><b>3.Parallel Processing approach-</b><br />
                        <br>Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among
                        multiple processors.<br />
                        A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a
                        program in less time by dividing them.<br />
                        This approach seems to be like divide and conquer.<br />
                        Examples are NESL (one of the oldest one) and C/C++ also supports because of some library
                        function.</p> <br />
                    <p style="font-size:150%"><b>Declarative Programming Paradigm</b></p><br />
                    <p>It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database. In computer science the declarative programming is
                        a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its
                        control flow.<br />
                        It often considers programs as theories of some logic.It may simplify writing parallel programs.
                        The focus is on what needs to be done rather how it should be done basically emphasize on what
                        code code is actually doing.<br />
                        It just declare the result we want rather how it has be produced.<br />
                        This is the only difference between imperative (how to do) and declarative (what to do)
                        programming paradigms.</p><br />
                    <p><b>1.Logic programming paradigms-</b><br />
                        <br>It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like
                        puzzles, series etc.<br />
                        In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question
                        and knowledge base<br />
                        which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of
                        knowledge base is not <br />
                        available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some
                        models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism.</p><br />
                    <p><b>2.Functional programming paradigm</b><br />
                        <br>The functional programming paradigms has its roots in mathematics and it is language
                        independent.<br />
                        The key principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. <br />
                        The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific
                        computation<br />
                        and not the data structure. Data are loosely coupled to functions.The function hide their
                        implementation.<br />
                        Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program. Some of
                        the languages<br />
                        like perl, javascript mostly uses this paradigm.</p><br />
                    <p><b>3.Database/Data driven programming approach –</b><br />
                        <br>This programming methodology is based on data and its movement.<br />
                        Program statements are defined by data rather than hard-coding a series of steps. <br />
                        A database program is the heart of a business information system and provides file
                        creation,<br />
                        data entry, update, query and reporting functions. There are several programming languages
                        that<br />
                        are developed mostly for database application. For example SQL. It is applied to streams of
                        structured data,<br />
                        for filtering, transforming, aggregating (such as computing statistics), or calling other
                        programs. <br />
                        So it has its own wide application.</p><br />

                        <br />
                        <p>Some of the advantages of Server Side programs are as follows:</p><br />
                        <br />
                        <ol><br />
                            <li>. All programs reside in one machine called server. Any number of remote machines
                                (called clients) can access the server programs.</li><br />
                            <li>New functionalities to existing programs can be added at the server side which the
                                clients can take advantage of without having to change anything.</li><br />
                            <li>Migrating to newer versions, architectures, design patterns, adding patches, switching
                                to new databases can be done at the server side without having to bother about client’s
                                hardware or software capabilities.</li><br />
                            <li>. Issues relating to enterprise applications like resource management, concurrency,
                                session management, security and performance are managed by the server side applications
                            </li><br />
                            <li>They are portable and possess the capability to generate dynamic and user-based content
                                (e.g., displaying transaction information of credit card or debit card depending on
                                user’s choice).</li><br />
                        </ol><br><br><br />

                    <br />
                    <p>My The common gateway interface (CGI) is a standard way for a Web server to pass a Web user's
                        request to an application program and to receive data back to forward to the user. When the user
                        requests a Web page (for example, by clicking on a highlighted word or entering a Web site
                        address), the server sends back the requested page. However, when a user fills out a form on a
                        Web page and sends it in, it usually needs to be processed by an application program. The Web
                        server typically passes the form information to a small application program that processes the
                        data and may send back a confirmation message. This method or convention for passing data back
                        and forth between the server and the application is called the common gateway interface (CGI).
                        It is part of the Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p><br />

                    <h3>Features of CGI</h3><br />
                    <p>• It is a very well defined and supported standard.<br />
                        • CGI is a technology that interfaces with HTML<br />
                        • It is the best method to create a counter because it is currently the quickest <br />
                        • CGI standard is generally the most compatible with today’s browsers.</p><br />
                    <h2>Advantages of CGI</h2><br />
                    <p>• CGI specifies that the programs can be written in any language and on any platform.<br />
                        • CGI based counters and CGI code to perform simple tasks are available in plenty. </p><br />

                                <h3 style="color:blue;">LANGUAGES FOR CGI

                    <p><br />
                        You can use whatever language you want, although certain languages are more suited for CGI
                        programming than others. Before choosing a language, you must consider the following
                        features:<br />
                        • Ease of text manipulation<br />
                        • Ability to interface with other software libraries and utilities<br />
                        • Ability to access environment variables (in UNIX)<br />
                        Some of the more popular languages for CGI programming include AppleScript, C/C++, C Shell,
                        Perl, Tcl, and Visual Basic. Here is a quick review of the advantages and, in some cases,
                        disadvantages of each one.<br />
                        <br />
                        <i>C/C++ (UNIX, Windows, Macintosh)</i><br />
                        C and C++ are very popular with programmers, and some use them to do CGI programming. These
                        languages are not recommended for the novice programmer; C and C++ impose strict rules for
                        variable and memory declarations, and type checking. In addition, these languages lack database
                        extensions and inherent pattern-matching abilities, although modules and functions can be
                        written to achieve these functions.<br />
                        However, C and C++ have a major advantage in that you can compile your CGI application to create
                        a binary executable, which takes up fewer system resources than using interpreters (like Perl or
                        Tcl) to run CGI scripts.<br />
                        <br />
                        <i>C Shell (UNIX Only)</i><br />
                        C Shell lacks pattern-matching operators, and so other UNIX utilities, such as sed or awk, must
                        be used whenever you want to manipulate string information. However, there is a software tool,
                        called uncgi and written in C, that decodes form data and stores the information into shell
                        environment variables, which can be accessed rather easily. Obviously, communicating with a
                        database directly is impossible, unless it is done through a foreign application. Finally, the C
                        Shell has some serious bugs and limitations that make using it a dangerous proposition for the
                        beginner.<br />
                        <br />
                        <i>Perl (UNIX, Windows, Macintosh)</i><br />
                        Perl is by far the most widely used language for CGI programming! It contains many powerful
                        features, and is very easy for the novice programmer to learn. The advantages of Perl
                        include:<br />
                        • It is highly portable and readily available.<br />
                        • It contains extremely powerful string manipulation operators, as well as functions to deal
                        with binary data.<br />
                        • It contains very simple and concise constructs.<br />
                        • It makes calling shell commands very easy, and provides some useful equivalents of certain
                        UNIX system functions.<br />
                        • There are numerous extensions built on top of Perl for specialized functions; for example,
                        there is oraperl(or the DBI Extensions), which contains functions for interfacing with the
                        Oracle database.<br />
                        <br />
                        <i>Tcl (UNIX Only)</i><br />
                        Tcl is gaining popularity as a CGI programming language. Tcl consists of a shell, tclsh, which
                        can be used to execute your scripts. Like Perl, tclsh also contains simple constructs, but is a
                        bit more difficult to learn and use for the novice programmer. Like Perl, Tcl contains
                        extensions to databases and graphic libraries. It also supports regular expressions, but is
                        quite inefficient in handling these expressions at compile time, especially when compared to
                        Perl.</p><br />

                    <p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) provides the middleware between WWW servers and external
                        databases and information sources. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defined the Common
                        Gateway Interface (CGI) and also defined how a program interacts with a Hyper Text Transfer
                        Protocol (HTTP) server. The Web server typically passes the form information to a small
                        application program that processes the data and may send back a confirmation message. This
                        process or convention for passing data back and forth between the server and the application is
                        called the common gateway interface (CGI).<br />

                    <h1>Features of CGI</h1><br />
                    <p> It is a very well defined and supported standard.<br />
                        CGI is a technology that interfaces with HTML<br />
                        It is the best method to create a counter because it is currently the quickest <br />
                        CGI standard is generally the most compatible with today’s browsers<br />
                        CGI scripts are generally written in either Perl, C, or maybe just a simple shell script.<br />
                        <br />
                        .</p><br />
                    <h2>Advantages of CGI</h2><br />
                    <p> CGI specifies that the programs can be written in any language and on any platform.<br />
                        CGI based counters and CGI code to perform simple tasks are available in plenty.<br />
                        The advanced tasks are currently a lot easier to perform in CGI than in Java.<br />
                        It is always easier to use the code already written than to write your own. </p><br />
                    <h3>Disvantage of CGI</h3><br />
                    <p> Common Gateway Interface each page load incurs overhead by having to load the programs into
                        memory.<br />
                        In CGI data cannot be easily cached in memory between page loads.<br />
                        There is a huge existing code base, much of it in Perl.<br />
                        CGI uses up a lot of processing time. </p><br />

                        </strong></h4><br />
                    <p><br />
                        CGI turns the Web from a simple collection of static hypermedia documents into a whole new
                        interactive medium, in which users can ask questions and run applications. <br />
                        There are some of the possible applications that can be designed using CGI.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <i>Forms</i><br />
                        It is the most prominent uses of CGI is in processing forms. Forms are a subset of HTML that
                        allow the user to supply information. The forms interface makes Web browsing an interactive
                        process for the user and the provider,a number of graphical widgets are available for form
                        creation, such as radio buttons, text fields, checkboxes, and selection lists. When the form is
                        completed by the user, the Submit Order! button is used to send the information to the server,
                        which executes the program associated with the particular form to "decode" the data.<br />
                        <br />
                        Generally, forms are used for two main purposes. At their simplest, forms can be used to collect
                        information from the user. But they can also be used in a more complex manner to provide
                        back-and-forth interaction. For example, the user can be presented with a form listing the
                        various documents available on the server, as well as an option to search for particular
                        information within these documents. A CGI program can process this information and return
                        document(s) that match the user's selection criteria.<br />

                        <br />
                        <i>GATEWAYS</i><br />
                        <br />
                        Web gateways are programs or scripts used to access information that is not directly readable by
                        the client. For example, say you have an Oracle database that contains baseball statistics for
                        all the players on your company team and you would like to provide this information on the Web.
                        How would you do it? You certainly cannot point your client to the database file (i.e., open the
                        URL associated with the file) and expect to see any meaningful data.<br />
                        <br />
                        CGI provides a solution to the problem in the form of a gateway. You can use a language such as
                        oraperl or a DBI extension to Perl to form SQL queries to read the information contained within
                        the database. Once you have the information, you can format and send it to the client. In this
                        case, the CGI program serves as a gateway to the Oracle database, Similarly, you can write
                        gateway programs to any other Internet information service, including Archie, WAIS, and NNTP
                        (Usenet News).In addition, you can amplify the power of gateways by using the forms interface to
                        request a query or search string from the user to retrieve and display dynamic, or virtual,
                        information. We will discuss these special documents next.<br />

                        <i>VIRTUAL DOCUMENTS</i><br />
                        <br />
                        Virtual, or dynamic, document creation is at the heart of CGI. Virtual documents are created on
                        the fly in response to a user's information request. You can create virtual HTML, plain text,
                        image, and even audio documents. A simple example of a virtual document could be something as
                        trivial as this:<br />
                        <br />
                        Welcome to Shishir's WWW Server!<br />
                        You are visiting from diamond.com. The load average on this machine is 1.25.<br />
                        Happy navigating!<br />
                        <br />
                        There are two pieces of dynamic information: the alphanumeric address (IP name) of the remote
                        user and the load average on the serving machine.<br />
                        <br />
                        On the other hand, very complex virtual documents can be created by writing programs that use a
                        combination of graphics libraries, gateways, and forms. As a more sophisticated example, say you
                        are the manager of an art gallery that specializes in selling replicas of ancient Renaissance
                        paintings and you are interested in presenting images of these masterpieces on the Web. You
                        start out by creating a form that asks for user information for the purpose of promotional
                        mailings, presents a search field for the user to enter the name of a painting, as well as a
                        selection list containing popular paintings. Once the user submits the form to the server, a
                        program can email the user information to a certain address, or store it in a file. And
                        depending on the user's selection, either a message stating that the painting does not exist or
                        an image of the painting can be displayed along with some historical information located
                        elsewhere on the Internet.<br />
                        <br />
                        Along with the picture and history, another form with several image processing options to modify
                        the brightness, contrast, and/or size of the picture can be displayed. You can write another CGI
                        program to modify the image properties on the fly using certain graphics libraries, such as gd,
                        sending the resultant picture to the client.<br />
                        This is an example of a more complex CGI program using many aspects of CGI programming.</p>

                        -->A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to
                        other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources
                        with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web
                        servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.<br />
                        -->To function as a server, a device must be configured to listen to requests from clients on a

                        <br />
                        File servers store and distribute files. Multiple clients or users may share files stored on a
                        server. In addition, centrally storing files offers easier backup or fault tolerance solutions
                        than attempting to provide security and integrity for files on every device in an organization.
                        File server hardware can be designed to maximize read and write speeds to improve
                        performance.<br />

                        Print servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Print servers allow for the management and distribution of printing functionality. Rather than
                        attaching a printer to every workstation, a single print server can respond to printing requests
                        from numerous clients. Today, some larger and higher-end printers come with their own built-in
                        print server, which removes the need for an additional computer-based print server. This
                        internal print server also functions by responding to print requests from a client.<br />
                        <br />
                        Application servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Application servers run applications in lieu of client computers running applications locally.
                        Application servers often run resource-intensive applications that are shared by a large number
                        of users. Doing so removes the need for each client to have sufficient resources to run the
                        applications. It also removes the need to install and maintain software on many machines as
                        opposed to only one.<br />

                        DNS servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Domain Name System (DNS) servers are application servers that provide name resolution to client
                        computers by converting names easily understood by humans into machine-readable IP addresses.
                        The DNS system is a widely distributed database of names and other DNS servers, each of which
                        can be used to request an otherwise unknown computer name. When a client needs the address of a
                        system, it sends a DNS request with the name of the desired resource to a DNS server. The DNS
                        server responds with the necessary IP address from its table of names.<br />
                        <br />
                        Mail servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Mail servers are a very common type of application server. Mail servers receive emails sent to a
                        user and store them until requested by a client on behalf of said user. Having an email server
                        allows for a single machine to be properly configured and attached to the network at all times.
                        It is then ready to send and receive messages rather than requiring every client machine to have
                        its own email subsystem continuously running.<br />

                        One of the most abundant types of servers in today’s market is a web server. A web server is a
                        special kind of application server that hosts programs and data requested by users across the
                        Internet or an intranet. Web servers respond to requests from browsers running on client
                        computers for web pages, or other web-based services. Common web servers include Apache web
                        servers, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers and Nginx servers.<br />

                        The amount of data used by companies, users, and other services is staggering. Much of that data
                        is stored in databases. Databases need to be accessible to multiple clients at any given time
                        and can require extraordinary amounts of disk space. Both of these needs lend themselves well to
                        locating such databases on servers. Database servers run database applications and respond to
                        numerous requests from clients. Common database server applications include Oracle, Microsoft
                        SQL Server, DB2, and Informix.<br />

                        Virtual servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Virtual servers are taking the server world by storm. Unlike traditional servers that are
                        installed as an operating system on machine hardware, virtual servers exist only as defined
                        within specialized software called hypervisor. Each hypervisor can run hundreds, or even
                        thousands, of virtual servers all at once. The hypervisor presents virtual hardware to the
                        server as if it were real physical hardware. The virtual server uses the virtual hardware as
                        usual, and the hypervisor passes the actual computation and storage needs onto the real hardware
                        beneath, which is shared among all the other virtual servers.<br />

                        Proxy servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. Often used to isolate
                        either the clients or servers for security purposes, a proxy server takes the request from the
                        client. Instead of responding to the client, it passes the request on to another server or
                        process. The proxy server receives the response from the second server and then replies to the
                        original client as if it were replying on its own. In this way, neither the client nor the
                        responding server needs to directly connect to each other.<br />
                        <br />
                        Monitoring and management servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Some servers exist to monitor or manage other systems and clients. There are many types of
                        monitoring servers. Several of them listen to the network and receive every client request and
                        server response, but some do not request or respond to data themselves. In this way, the
                        monitoring server can keep track of all the traffic on the network, as well as the requests and
                        replies of clients and servers, without interfering with those operations. A monitoring server
                        will respond to requests from monitoring clients such as those run by network administrators
                        watching the health of the network.<br />

                    <p>Microsoft Windows servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        An argument can be made that Windows for Workgroups was Microsoft’s first server operating
                        system. In that version, certain computers could be set to share resources and respond to
                        requests from clients, which made them servers by definition. Microsoft’s first real server
                        operating system was Windows NT. Its 3.5 and 3.51 versions ran on many business networks until
                        Microsoft released its Windows Server line that continues to exist today. The most current
                        Windows Server version is Windows Server 2016. This version supports numerous applications and
                        databases as well as a hypervisor that allows virtual servers.<br />

                        Linux / Unix servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        The other major player in server operating systems is the Linux/Unix realm. There are multiple
                        versions and flavors of Linux/Unix including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, and CentOS. As an
                        open-source operating system, Linux is very popular as a web server, often with the Apache web
                        application server installed.<br />
                        <br />
                        NetWare:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Although no longer made, NetWare was a major player in the server software space as the
                        client-server era was ramping up. Eventually, NetWare moved its server operating system to a
                        Linux-based kernel and named it a Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES).<br />
                        <br />
                        Cloud servers:-<br />
                        <br />
                        Virtual servers hosted on a third-party infrastructure on an open network, such as the Internet,
                        are called cloud servers. There are numerous cloud server providers these days, including
                        Google’s Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud.<br />
                        However, the main pioneer of corporate cloud computing was Amazon’s AWS platform. It originally
                        started using spare capacity of Amazon’s own servers and networks, but AWS now allows customers
                        to create a virtual server nearly instantly and then adjust the amount of resources that server
                        may use on the fly.<br />
                        Today, a server can be nothing more than the data of physical hardware that consists of multiple
                        processors, disk drives, memory, and network connections. But, even now, a server is still just
                        a system that responds to a request from a client.<br />

                    Environment Variables<br />
                    Environment variables enable you to use symbolic names for elements of the file system structure.
                    Server names and path specification can be encoded using environment variables. The advantage of
                    using variables instead of hard coded names is that it enables you to move databases and tables to
                    another system or location.<br />
                    <br />
                    An environment variable is represented by:<br />
                    <br />
                    name <br />
                    <br />
                    where:<br />
                    <br />
                    name:-<br />
                    <br />
                    Case-insensitive symbolic name.<br />
                    <br />
                    The content of the variable can be any string. In addition, an environment variable can use (refer
                    to) another environment variable.<br />
                    <br />
                    Reserved Variables<br />
                    <br />
                    The following variables are reserved:<br />

                    <br />
                    Replaced by the path to the current database MD directory.<br />

                    ROOT<br />
                    <br />
                    Replaced by an empty string to specify the D3 file system root.<br />

                    Variable Locations<br />
                    <br />
                    Environment variables are stored in the Catalogue,Environment table in the dm database on the MDS
                    server.<br />
                    <br />
                    Variable Types<br />
                    <br />
                    Variables are global to the domain and are either:<br />

                    <h2>COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE(CGI):</h2><br />
                    <p>A Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program can be written in any language that allows it to be
                        executed on a computer. The most commonly used languages for CGI at present are C and Perl. CGI
                        programs written in C typically have to be compiled. They are difficult to modify and maintain.
                        Therefore, many people prefer to write CGI programs in Perl, which is interpretive and resembles
                        C language. However, writing and maintaining a large program in Perl is dreadful.</p><br />
                    <h2> CGI Building blocks:</h2><br />
                    <p>Ch is a superset of C interpreter with classes in C++. Existing C code can readily be used for
                        CGI. The Ch language environment has been developed to be especially suitable for Web
                        programming. The classes CResponse, CRequest, CServer, and CCookie are the basic building blocks
                        for CGI in Ch. These CGI classes support wide character. They significantly simplify Web-based
                        application development. For example, the code below can be used to display all environmental
                        variables in common gateway interface in different platforms of Unix, Linux, and Windows.</p>

                            int main() {<br />
                            int i;<br />
                            CResponse Response;<br />
                            Response.begin();<br />
                            Response.title("Environment values");<br />
                            printf("<H1> Environment values</H1>\n");<br />
                            for(i=0; environ[i] != NULL; i++) {<br />
                            printf("%s<br>\n", environ[i]);<br />
                            }<br />
                            Response.end();<br />
                            }<br />
                            <br />
                            CGI programming in Ch is simple, easy, and fun. This Web Calculator is just one of the
                            typical application examples.<br />
                            <br />
                            The following extensions of Ch over C make it ideal for programming in Common Gateway

                                    including error messages from execution of the CGI script, will be displayed inside

                                <li>High-level classes for CGI have been developed for CGI programming. These classes
                                    include CResponse, CRequest, CServer and CCookie. For example, the following Ch CGI

                                    as a standard output stream in a CGI program. For example, the CGI program

                        The simplest possible CGI script would, upon execution, create this simple, static page as its
                        output. Here is how this CGI program would look if you wrote it in C:<br />
                        <br />
                        #include <stdio.h><br />
                            <br />
                            int main()<br />
                            {<br />
                            printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");<br />
                            printf("<html>\n");<br />
                            printf("

                            <body>\n");<br />
                                printf("<h1>Hello there!</h1>\n");<br />
                                printf("</body>\n");<br />
                            printf("

                            </html>\n");<br />
                            return 0;<br />
                            }<br />
                            On my Web server, I entered this program into the file simplest.c and then compiled it by
                            saying:<br />
                            <br />
                            gcc simplest.c -o simplest.cgi<br />
                            (See How C Programming Works for details on compiling C programs.)<br />
                            <br />
                            By placing simplest.cgi in the cgi-bin directory, it can be executed. As you can see, all
                            that the script does is <br />
                            generate a page that says, "Hello there!" The only part that is unexpected is the line that
                            says:<br />
                            <br />
                            printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");<br />
                            The line "Content-type: text/html\n\n" is special piece of text that must be the first thing
                            sent to the browser by any CGI script. As long as you remember to do that, everything will
                            be fine. If you forget, the browser will reject the output of the script.<br />
                            You have just seen the basic idea behind CGI scripting. It is really that simple! A program
                            executes and its output is sent to the browser that called the script. Normal output sent to
                            stdout is what gets sent to the browser.<br />
                            The whole point of CGI scripting, however, is to create dynamic content -- each time the
                            script executes, the output should be different. After all, if the output is the same every
                            time you run the script, then you might as well use a static page. The following C program
                            demonstrates very simple dynamic content:<br />
                            <br />
                            #include <stdio.h><br />
                                int incrementcount()<br />
                                {<br />
                                FILE *f;<br />
                                int i;<br />
                                <br />
                                f=fopen("count.txt", "r+");<br />
                                if (!f)<br />
                                {<br />
                                sleep(1);<br />
                                f=fopen("count.txt", "r+");<br />
                                if (!f)<br />
                                return -1;<br />
                                }<br />
                                fscanf(f, "%d", &i);<br />
                                i++;<br />
                                fseek(f,0,SEEK_SET);<br />
                                fprintf(f, "%d", i);<br />
                                fclose(f);<br />
                                return i;<br />
                                }<br />
                                <br />
                                int main()<br />
                                {<br />
                                printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");<br />
                                printf("<html>\n");<br />
                                printf("

                                <body>\n");<br />
                                    printf("<h1>The current count is: ")<br />
                                        printf("%d</h1>\n", incrementcount());<br />
                                    printf("</body>\n");<br />
                                printf("

                                </html>\n");<br />
                                return 0;<br />
                                }<br />
                                With a text editor, type this program into a file named count.c. Compile it by
                                typing:<br />
                                <br />
                                gcc count.c -o count.cgi<br />
                                Create another text file named count.txt and place a single zero in it. By placing
                                counter.cgi and count.txt in the cgi-bin directory, you can run the script. All that the
                                script does is generate a page that says, "The current count is: X," where X increments
                                once each time you run the script. Try running it several times and watch the content of
                                the page change!<br />
                                <br />
                                The count.txt file holds the current count, and the little incrementcount() function is
                                the function that increments the count in the count.txt file. This function opens the
                                count.txt file, reads the number from it, increments the number and writes it back to
                                the file. The function actually tries to open the file twice. It does that just in case
                                two people try to access the file simultaneously. It certainly is not a foolproof
                                technique, but for something this simple it works. If the file cannot be opened on the
                                second attempt, -1 is the error value returned to the caller. A more sophisticated
                                program would recognize the -1 return value and generate an appropriate error message.

                    </h1>
                    INTRODUCTION.<br />
                    i covered the basics of using bash shell scripts for web server CGI. Default Red Hat Linux directory
                    configurations for Apache are used in this tutorial. The HTML ISINDEX tag is used for data input to
                    the script.<br />
                    <br />
                    CGI uses two methods to pass data between the browser and the web server, GET and POST. The GET
                    method passes data in the URL and is the method employed here. The web server will pass environment
                    variables into the execution environment of the CGI shell script which also may be used.<br />
                    <br />
                    Simple output of a text file:<br />
                    CGI Shell script to output a text page: /var/www/cgi-bin/cat-a-text-page<br />
                    <br />
                    #!/bin/bash<br />
                    CAT=/bin/cat<br />
                    COLCRT=/usr/bin/colcrt<br />
                    <br />
                    echo Content-type: text/plain<br />
                    echo ""<br />
                    <br />
                    if [[ -x $CAT && -x $COLCRT ]]<br />
                    then<br />
                    $CAT $1 | $COLCRT<br />
                    else<br />
                    echo Cannot find command on this system.<br />
                    fi<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Usage: <A HREF="/cgi-bin/cat-a-text-page?/home/user1/public_html/text-file.txt">Text of
                        link</A><br />
                    <br />
                    Note:<br />
                    the permissions on the shell script must changed to make the script executable: chmod +x
                    cat-a-text-page<br />
                    the shell /bin/sh was often used in older systems and was a link to /bin/bash (most Red Hat Linux
                    systems). The behavior of shells other than Bash is not covered in this tutorial. Debian currently
                    softlinks /bin/sh to /bin/dash which does not behave the same. It is best to specify the Bash shell
                    explicitly: #!/bin/bash<br />
                    Simple example to output a text file formatted as HTML:<br />
                    CGI Shell script: /var/www/cgi-bin/Output-text-as-html<br />
                    <br />
                    #!/bin/bash<br />
                    <br />
                    echo Content-type: text/html<br />
                    echo ""<br />
                    <br />
                    /bin/cat

                    Text entered: /tmp/text-file.txt<br />
                    The following will get generated: http://localhost/cgi-bin/catpage?%2Ftmp%2Ftext-file.txt<br />
                    The CGI will then spit out the text page specified.<br />
                    <br />
                    [Potential Pitfall]: Currently Mozilla 1.2.1 (Also default Red Hat 8.0 and 9.0) browsers have a bug
                    which prevents this from operating properly. Konqueror, Netscape, Lynx all work properly.<br />
                    <br />
                    Shell script using ISINDEX in simple search:<br />
                    In this case the script will generate all displayed interfaces. This example is the easiest form of
                    a simple on-line database. (Grep/search a file and output the results of the search)<br />

                    [Potential Pitfall]: ISINDEX is getting old and is less supported in modern browsers. The above

                    page.<br />

        CGI.pm: CGI.pm (Use CGI;) is a large and widely used Perl module for programming CGI web applications, which
        provides a consistent API for receiving and processing user input. We need to write a Perl script in order to
        return an HTTP response header(Content-type: html/text) and HTML in the body but CGI.pm handles it easily for us
        (no need to hard-code for HTTP response header).<br />
        It has a function named “param” which sends back the details/information about the data which we have passed to
        the script. It returns the values associated with that name when it is given the name of a parameter. Names of
        the input elements in the HTML form page are the CGI parameter names.<br />

            </h1>
            <br />
            <p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) provides the middleware between WWW servers and external databases and
                information sources. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defined the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and
                also defined how a program interacts with a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. The Web server
                typically passes the form information to a small application program that processes the data and may
                send back a confirmation message. This process or convention for passing data back and forth between the
                server and the application is called the common gateway interface (CGI).</p><br />
            <br />
            <h2> CGI Security Breach : Origins and Sequences </h2><br />
            <p>The first step towards tackling the CGI security issues requires finding the origins of the problems.
                This in turn requires identification of all the different components involved in the entire CGI
                communication process. (Note that not all of these are involved in all cases.) They are:<br />
                <ul><br />
                    <li>The User. A person including an intruder (such as a hacker, masquerader, counterfeiter, an
                        eavesdropper) or a program (such as a virus).</li><br />
                    <li> HTML form or searchable index.</li><br />
                    <li>HTTP and CGI protocols.</li><br />
                    <li> The CGI script.</li><br />
                    <li>Compiler/interpreter that runs the CGI script (which depends on the language the script is
                        written in).</li><br />
                    <li> External data (that comes from the user in 1. above).</li><br />
                    <li> External programs that the script calls.</li><br />
                    <li> Client-side techniques, such as JavaScript, used in conjunction with the CGI.</li><br />
                    <li> The Web browser.</li><br />
                    <li> The Web server.</li><br />
                </ul><br />
                <h3> CGI communication between web client and server</h3><br />

                <br />
                CGI scripts can present security holes in two ways:<br />
                <br />
                1.They may intentionally or unintentionally leak information about the host system that can result in a
                break in.<br />
                2.Scripts that process remote user input, such as the contents of a form or a "searchable index"
                command, may be vulnerable to attacks in which the remote user tricks them into executing
                commands.<br />
                Security holes present in CGI scripts on Web sites can be exploited for various frivolous purposes,
                including the following:<br />
                <ul><br />
                    <li>Critical files, particularly those which contain sensitive information (such as passwords), are
                        stolen, modified or erased by unauthorized users.</li><br />
                    <li>Content is sold to a competitor.</li><br />
                    <li>Information about the host machine is obtained which will allow unauthorized users to have
                        access to the system.</li><br />
                    <li>Commands are executed on the server host machine, allowing unauthorized users to modify the
                        system.</li><br />
                    <li>The site is used to launch attacks against other sites.</li><br />

                Topic: 4.12: Alternatives and Enhancement to CGI
            </h1>
            <br />
            <h3>Introduction to alternatives to CGI</h3><br />
            <p><br />
                As its title suggests, this book focuses on CGI programs written in Perl. Because Perl and CGI are so
                often used together, some people are unclear about the distinction. Perl is a programming language, and
                CGI is an interface that a program uses to handle requests from a web server. There are alternatives
                both to CGI and to Perl: there are new alternatives to CGI for handling dynamic requests, and CGI
                applications can be written in a variety of languages.</p><br />
            <h3>Alternatives to CGI</h3><br />
            <p>Several alternatives to CGI have appeared in recent years. They all build upon CGI's legacy and provide
                their own approaches to the same underlying goal: responding to queries and presenting dynamic content
                via HTTP. Most of them also attempt to avoid the <br />
                <br>main drawback to CGI scripts: creating a separate process to execute the script every time it is
                requested. Others also try to make less of a distinction between HTML pages and code by moving code into
                HTML page</p><br />
            <h3> Introductio to Enhancement to CGI</h3><br />
            <p>This module adds a few enhancements to CGI::Safe, which itself adds a few security-based enancements to
                CGI.pm. The enhancement are almost entirely additions - the only method that is overridden is new(), and
                the changes there are only addition. The enhancements in this module entirely use the object-oriented
                interface.</p><br />
            <h3> what is CGI and fast CGI </h3><br />
            <p>CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a web technology and protocol that defines a way for a web server (HTTP
                server) to interact with external applications, e.g. PHP. CGI enhances the web server capabilities to
                enable dynamic content generation and processing.<br />
                <br />
                CGI is used as an interface between the web server and the additionally installed applications
                generating dynamic web content. These applications are called CGI scripts and are written in different
                script and programming languages such as PHP, Perl, Python, etc.<br />
                <br />
                Back at the dawn of the World Wide Web the first web servers provided pages containing pre-written HTML
                code. This content could not have been changed, unless its developer had not modified the .html file.
                Web content used to be static and the available webpage code was passed from the web server to the
                browser.<br />
                <br />
                With the CGI technology, however, the web server does not respond with an existing HTML file, but
                executes an application where it transfers the HTTP request data. The application then accepts and
                processes the arguments as it returns the output data to the web server. Only then the server returns a
                response to the request while forwarding the generated HTML code.</p><br />

            </h1>
            <br />
            <p>All of us would have started programming in java with the famous “hello world” program. If you can
                recollect, we saved the file with a ‘.java’ extension and later compiled the program using ‘javac’ and
                then executed the program using ‘java’. Apart from introducing you to the language basics, the important
                point is that it is a client-side program. That means you write, compile and execute the program in the
                client machine (i.e., your PC). No doubt, it is the easiest and fastest way to write, compile and
                execute the program. However, it has little practical significance when it comes to real-world
                programming.</p><br />
            <br />
            <h2>Why Server Side Programming</h2><br />
            <p> Though it is technically feasible to implement almost any business logic using client-side programs,
                logically or functionally it server no purpose when it comes to enterprises application (e.g., banking,
                air ticketing, e-shopping, etc). To further explain, going by the client-side programming logic; a bank
                having 10,000customers would mean that each customer would have a copy of the program(s) in his or her
                PC (and now even mobiles) which translates to 10,000 programs! In addition, there are issues like
                security, resource pooling, concurrent access and manipulations to the database which simply cannot be
                handled by client-side programs. The answer to most of the issues cited above is-“Server Side
                Programming”. Figure illustrates the Server Side Architecture in the simplest way.</p><br />
            <img src="https://ecomputernotes.com/images/Server-Side-Programming-Architecture.jpg"><br />
            <h2>Some of the advantages of Server Side programs are as follows:</h2><br />
            <br />
            i.All programs reside in one machine called server. Any number of remote machines (called clients) can
            access the server programs.<br />
            ii. New functionalities to existing programs can be added at the server side which the clients can take
            advantage of without having to change anything.<br />
            iii. Migrating to newer versions, architectures, design patterns, adding patches, switching to new databases
            can be done at the server side without having to bother about client’s hardware or software
            capabilities.<br />
            iv. Issues relating to enterprise applications like resource management, concurrency, session management,
            security and performance are managed by the server side applications.<br />
            v. They are portable and possess the capability to generate dynamic and user-based content (e.g., displaying
            transaction information of credit card or debit card depending on user’s choice).<br />
            <br />
            <h2>Types of Server Side Programs</h2><br />
            The following are the different types of server side programs:<br />
            <br />
            (a) Active Server Pages (ASP)<br />
            (b) Java Servlets<br />
            (c) Java Server Pages (JSP)<br />

            <p> A servlet can imagined to be as an applet running on the server side. Some of the other server side
                technologies available are Common Gateway Interface (CGI), server side JavaScript and Active Server
                Pages (ASP).There are quite a number of servlet alternative since servlet is just an implementation of
                HTTP request and response mechanism based on Java.<br />
                <br />
                Almost all languages has a mechanism to deal with HTTP methods. They just not called 'servlet'. For
                example node.js has great tools for this. Have a look at express.js which is arguable most used node.js
                framework. </p><br />

            <h3> CGI:</h3><br />
            <p> The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) provides the middleware between WWW servers and external databases
                and information sources. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defined the Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
                and also defined how a program interacts with a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. The Web
                server typically passes the form information to a small application program that processes the data and
                may send back a confirmation message. This process or convention for passing data back and forth between
                the server and the application is called the common gateway interface (CGI).<br />
                <br />
                Features of CGI:<br />
                <br />
                It is a very well defined and supported standard.<br />
                CGI scripts are generally written in either Perl, C, or maybe just a simple shell script.<br />
                CGI is a technology that interfaces with HTML.<br />
                CGI is the best method to create a counter because it is currently the quickest<br />
                CGI standard is generally the most compatible with today’s browsers<br />
                <br />
                Advantages of CGI:<br />
                <br />
                The advanced tasks are currently a lot easier to perform in CGI than in Java.<br />
                It is always easier to use the code already written than to write your own.<br />
                CGI specifies that the programs can be written in any language, and on any platform, as long as they
                conform to the specification.<br />
                CGI-based counters and CGI code to perform simple tasks are available in plenty.<br />
                <br />
                Disadvantages of CGI:<br />
                <br />
                There are some disadvantages of CGI which are given below:<br />
                In Common Gateway Interface each page load incurs overhead by having to load the programs into
                memory.<br />
                Generally, data cannot be easily cached in memory between page loads.<br />
                There is a huge existing code base, much of it in Perl.<br />
                CGI uses up a lot of processing time.</p><br />

                <li> It is a server side technology.</li><br />
                <li> It is used for creating web application.</li><br />
                <li> It is used to create dynamic web content.</li><br />
                <li> In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages.</li><br />
                <li> It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology.</li><br />
                <li> It is a Web based technology helps us to create dynamic and platform independent web page</li>
                <br />
                <li> In this, Java code can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both.</li><br />
                <li> JSP is first converted into servlet by JSP container before processing the clientrequest</li><br />
            </ul><br />
            <h4>JSP pages are more advantageous than Servlet:</h4><br />
            <ul><br />
                <li>They are easy to maintain.</li><br />
                <li> No recompilation or redeployment is required.</li><br />
                <li> JSP has access to entire API of JAVA .</li><br />
                <li> JSP are extended version of servlet</li><br />
            </ul><br />
            <h4>Features of JSP:</h4><br />
            <ul><br />
                <li>Coding in JSP is easy :- As it is just adding JAVA code to HTML/XML.</li><br />
                <li>Reduction in the length of Code :- In JSP we use action tags, custom tags etc.</li><br />
                <li>Connection to Database is easier :-It is easier to connect website to database and allows to read or
                    write data easily to the database.</li><br />
                <li>Make Interactive websites :- In this we can create dynamic web pages which helps user to interact in
                    real time environment.</li><br />
                <li>Portable, Powerful, flexible and easy to maintain :- as these are browser and server independent.
                </li><br />
                <li>No Redeployment and No Re-Compilation :- It is dynamic, secure and platform independent so no need
                    to re-compilation.</li><br />
                <li>Extension to Servlet :- as it has all features of servlets, implicit objects and custom tags</li>
                <br />
            </ul><br />
            <h4>JSP syntax:</h4><br />
            <ol><br />
                Syntax available in JSP are following:<br />
                <li>Declaration Tag :-It is used to declare variables.</li><br />
                Syntax:- <br />
                <%!  Dec var  %><br />
                Example:-<br />
                <%! int var=10; %><br />
                <br />
                <li>Java Scriplets :- It allows us to add any number of JAVA code, variables and expressions.</li><br />
                Syntax:- <br />
                <% java code %><br />
                <li>JSP Expression :- It evaluates and convert the expression to a string.</li><br />
                Syntax:- <br />
                <%= expression %> <br />
                Example:- <br />
                <% num1 = num1+num2 %> <br />
                <li>JAVA Comments :- It contains the text that is added for information which has to be ignored.</li>
                <br />
                Syntax:- <br />
                <% -- JSP Comments %><br />
            </ol><br />
            <h4>Advantages of using JSP:</h4><br />
            <ul><br />

            </ul><br />
            <h3>ASP:</h3><br />
            <p>ASP: ASP stands for Active Server Pages. It is a development framework used for building web pages. ASP
                was introduced in 1998 by Microsoft as its first server side scripting language. The file extension of
                ASP pages are .asp and are normally written in VBScript. It is an old but still powerful tool for making
                dynamic web pages. ASP is a technology (much like PHP) for executing scripts on a web server.</p><br />
            <ul><br />
                <li>ASP is the interpreted languages.</li> <br />
                <li>ASP uses ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) technology to connect and work with databases.</li> <br />
                <li>ASP is partially object oriented.</li> <br />
                <li>ASP Pages have the file extension .asp</li><br />
                <li>ASP doesn’t have the concept of inheritance.</li> <br />
                <li>ASP pages use scripting language.</li><br />
            </ul><br />
            <h3>ASP.NET:</h3><br />
            <p>ASP.NET was released in 2002 by Microsoft as a successor to ASP. It is also a server-side web framework,
                open source, which is designed for the generation of dynamic web pages. The file extension of ASP.NET
                pages are .aspx and are normally written in C# (C sharp). The latest version of ASP.NET is ASP.NET 4.6.
            </p><br />
            <ul><br />
                <li>ASP.NET is the compiled language.<br />
                <li> ASP.NET uses ADO.NET to connect and work with database.</li><br />
                <li>ASP.NET is fully object oriented.</li><br />
                <li> ASP.NET Pages have the file extension .aspx.</li><br />
                <li> ASP.NET inherit the class written in code behind.</li><br />
                <li>ASP.NET use full fledged programming language.</li><br />
                <li>Error handling is very good in ASP.NET.</li><br />
                <li>ASP.NET has more than 2000 in-built classes.</li><br />
            </ul><br />

            <p> The Servlet is a Java program which can run in Web server or Application server and act as a mediator
                from a web browser or client to the database or Server. For this Servlet, one can take input from the
                users through HTML or Web forms and can also take present records from databases and create web forms
                dynamically. A servlet can imagined to be as an applet running on the server side. Some of the other
                server side technologies available are Common Gateway Interface (CGI), server side JavaScript and Active
                Server Pages (ASP). Advantages of servlets over these server side technologies are as follows:</p><br />
            <h2>Strengths of servlets :</h2><br />
            <br />
            <ol><br />
                <li> Persistent: servlets remain in memory until explicitly destroyed. This helps in serving several
                    incoming requests. Servlets establishes connection only once with the database and can handle
                    several requests on the same database. This reduces the time and resources required to establish
                    connection again and again with the same database. Whereas, CGI programs are removed from the memory
                    once the request is processed and each time a new process is initiated whenever new request arrives.
                </li><br />
                <br />
                </li>Portable: Since servlets are written in Java, they are portable. That is, servlets are compatible
                with almost all operating systems. The programs written on one operating system can be executed on other
                operating system.</li><br />
                <br />
                <li>Server-independent: Servlets are compatible with any web server available today. Most of the
                    software vendors today support servlets within their web server products. On the other hand, some of
                    the server side technologies like server side JavaSricpt and ASP can run on only selected web
                    servers. The CGI is compatible with the web server that has features to supports it.</li><br />
                <br />
                <li>Protocol-independent: Servlets can be created to support any of the protocols like FTP commands,
                    Telnet sessions, NNTP newsgroups, etc. It also provides extended support for the functionality of
                    HTTP protocol.</li><br />
                <br />
                <li>Extensible: Servlets being written in Java, can be extended and polymorphed into the objects that
                    suits the user requirement.</li>. <br />
                <br />
                <li>Secure: Since servlets are server side programs and can be invoked by web server only, they inherit
                    all the security measures taken by the web server. They are also safe from the problems related to
                    memory management as Java does not support the concept of pointers and perform garbage collection
                    automatically.</li><br />
                <br />
                <li>Fast: Since servlets are compiled into bytecodes, they can execute more quickly as compared to other
                    scripting languages. The bytecode compilation feature helps servlets to give much better
                    performance. In addition, it also provides advantage of strong error and type checking.</li><br />

            <h2>Introduction</h2><br />
            <p>Servlet architecture comes under a java programming language used to create dynamic web applications.
                Mainly servlets are used to develop server-side applications. Servlets are very robust and scalable.
                Before introducing servlets CGI (common gateway interface) was used. Servlets are used to perform client
                request and response.<br />
                2.Generate dynamic web content.<br />
                3.Server-side load balancing. Ponse tasks dynamically. Servlets can be used to perform tasks like,<br />
                1.Control the flow of application.<br />
                4.implement business logic.</p></br><br />

                Web server is a program that sends HTTP response, and Servlet is a Java Program that deals with classes

                purely works on HTTP protocol. This is done using a web container present on the web server.<br />
            </p><br />
            <h1>WEBCONTAINER</h1><br />
            <p><br />
                A web container is built on top of the Java EE platform, and it implements the Servlet API and the
                services required to process HTTP (and other Transmission Control/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP])
                requests.<br />
                • Java Servlets are components that must exist in a web container. Web container activates the Servlet
                that matches the requested URL by calling the service method on an instance of Servlet class.<br />
                • Activation of the service method for a given HTTP request is handled in a separate thread within the
                web container protocol.<br />

                1.The Client browser sends an HTTP Request to the web server<br />
                2.Web server forwards requests to Web Container<br />
                3.Web Container forwards it to the Servlet in form of the request object<br />
                4.Servlet generates response object and sends it to the Web Container<br />
                5.Web container converts it into equivalent HTTP response to the web server<br />
                6.The web server sends HTML content via HTTP response back to the client browser.<br />

            <br />
            <h3> uses of servlet architecture</h3><br />
            <p>1.Servlets are used to form data manipulation like accepting form data and generating dynamic HTML
                pages.<br />
                2.Servlets helps in developing server load balancing applications. Where load balancing is among
                different servers.<br />
                3.Servlets are used as the middle tier in enterprise network platforms for connecting the SQL
                database.<br />
                4.Servlets can be integrated with applets to provide high-level interactivity and dynamic web content
                generation.<br />
                5.Servlet is used to develop applications where this act as an active agent in the middle tier, where
                they share data with each other.<br />
                6.Since the servlet supports various protocols like HTTP, FTF, etc. this helps in developing
                applications like file server applications, chat enabled applications</p><br />

            </h1>
            <br />
            <h2>Life cycle of a servlet</h2><br />
            <p>The web container maintains the life cycle of a servlet instance. Let's see the life cycle of the <br />
                servlet:<br />
                1.Servlet class is loaded.<br />
                2.Servlet instance is created.<br />
                3.init method is invoked.<br />
                4.service method is invoked.<br />
                5.destroy method is invoked.<br />
            </p></br><br />
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/servletlife.jpg" width="500px" height="500px"></br><br />
            <p>As displayed in the above diagram, there are three states of a servlet: new, ready and end. The <br />
                servlet is in new state if servlet instance is created. After invoking the init() method, Servlet comes
                <br />
                in the ready state. In the ready state, servlet performs all the tasks. When the web container invokes
                <br />
                the destroy() method, it shifts to the end state.<br />
            </p><br />
            <h3>Servlet class is loaded:</h3><br />
            <p>The classloader is responsible to load the servlet class. The servlet class is loaded when the <br />
                first request for the servlet is received by the web container.</p></br><br />
            <h3>Servlet instance is created:</h3><br />
            <p>The web container creates the instance of a servlet after loading the servlet class. The servlet <br />
                instance is created only once in the servlet life cycle.</p></br><br />
            <h3>init method is invoked:</h3><br />
            <p> The web container calls the init method only once after creating the servlet instance. The init <br />
                method is used to initialize the servlet. It is the life cycle method of the javax.servlet.Servlet
                <br />
                interface. </br>Syntax of the init method is given below:<br />
                <h3>public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException</h3>
            </p></br><br />
            <h3>service method is invoked</h3><br />
            <p> The web container calls the service method each time when request for the servlet is received. If <br />
                servlet is not initialized, it follows the first three steps as described above then calls the <br />
                service method. If servlet is initialized, it calls the service method. Notice that servlet is <br />
                initialized only once. </br>The syntax of the service method of the Servlet interface is given
                below:<br />
                <h3>public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) throws ServletException,
                    <br />
                    IOException </h3>
            </p></br><br />
            h1>destroy method is invoked:</h1><br />
            <p> The web container calls the destroy method before removing the servlet instance from the service. It
                <br />
                gives the servlet an opportunity to clean up any resource for example memory, thread etc.</br><br />
                The syntax of the destroy method of the Servlet interface is given below:<br />
                <h3>public void destroy()</h3>
            </p></br><br />

            <br />
            <p>HttpServlet is an abstract class given under the servlet-api present. It is present in javax.servlet.http
                package and has no abstract methods. It extends GenericServlet class.When the servlet container uses
                HTTP protocol to send request, then it creates HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects.
                HttpServletRequest binds the request information like header and request methods and HttpServletResponse
                binds all information of HTTP protocol.HttpServlet does not override in it or destroy method. However,
                it uses service (-,-) method. ServletRequest and ServletResponse references are cast into
                HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse, respectively.</p><br />

            <pre><br />
A simple Servlet application i.e LifeCycle application, that will demonstrate the implementation of the init(), service() and destroy() methods.<br />
if we are developing any Servlet application, it will handle some client’s request so, whenever we talk about Servlets we need to develop a index.html page (can be any other name also) which will request a particular Servlet to handle the request made by the client.<br />
</pre><br />
            <br />
            <h3>LifeCycle application contains 3 forms:</h3><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Creating the index.html page</li><br />

            <h2 style="color:red;"><b>Creating the index.html page:</b></h2><br />
            <pre> <br />

                    when we pass some information from browser to web server and the backend program. The browser uses

            Parameters may come into our application from the client request, or may be configured through deployment
            descriptor (web.xml) elements or their corresponding annotations. When you submit a form, form values are
            sent as request parameters to a web application. In case of a GET request, these parameters are exposed in
            the URL as name value pairs and in case of POST, parameters are sent within the body of the request. <br />

            <b style="color:blue;">INTRODUCTION:</b><br />
            <i><br />
                Server Side Includes, usually called simply <b style="color:green;">SSI.</b><br />
                SSI are directives that are placed in HTML pages, and evaluated on the server while the pages are being
                served. They let you add dynamically generated content to an existing HTML page, without having to serve
                the entire page via a CGI program, or other dynamic technology.<br />
                <br />
                eg:<i style="color:red;">*place a directive into an existing HTML page</i><br />
                <!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" --><br />
                <i style="color:red;">*when the page is served, this fragment will be evaluated and replaced with its
                    value:</i><br />
                Tuesday, 15-Jan-2013 19:28:54 EST<br />
                <br />
                <b style="color:blue;">BASIC SSI DIRECTIVES:</b><br />
                <i><br />
                    SSI directives have the following syntax:<br />
                    <br />
                    <!--#function attribute=value attribute=value ... --><br />
                    <br />
                    It is formatted like an HTML comment, so if you don't have SSI correctly enabled, the browser will
                    ignore it, but it will still be visible in the HTML source. If you have SSI correctly configured,
                    the directive will be replaced with its results.<br />
                </i><br />
                <b style="color:red;">Today's date</b><br />
                <!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" --><br />
                <br />
                The echo function just spits out the value of a variable. There are a number of standard variables,
                which include the whole set of environment variables that are available to CGI programs. Also, you can
                define your own variables with the set function.<br />
                <br />
                If you don't like the format in which the date gets printed, you can use the config function, with a
                timefmt attribute, to modify that formatting.<br />
                <br />
                <!--#config timefmt="%A %B %d, %Y" --><br />
                Today is
                <!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" --><br />
                <br />
                <b style="color:red;">Modification date of the file</b><br />
                This document last modified
                <!--#flastmod file="index.html" --><br />
                <br />
                This function is also subject to timefmt format configurations.<br />
                <br />
                <b style="color:red;">Including the results of a CGI program</b><br />
                This is one of the more common uses of SSI - to output the results of a CGI program, such as everybody's
                favorite, a ``hit counter.''<br />
                <br />
                <!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/counter.pl" --><br />

            </h1>
            An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data <br />
            that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store<br />
            it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Typically,<br />
            it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser — keeping a <br />
            user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the <br />
            stateless HTTP protocol<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Cookies are mainly used in:<br />
            <br />
            1. Session Management<br />
            2. Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember<br />
            3. Personalization<br />
            4. User preferences, themes, and other settings<br />
            5. Tracking<br />
            6. Recording and analyzing user behavior<br />
            <br />
            Cookies were once used for general client-side storage. While this was<br />
            legitimate when they were the only way to store data on the client, it <br />
            is now recommended to use modern storage APIs. Cookies are sent with every<br />
            request, so they can worsen performance (especially for mobile data connections).<br />
            Modern APIs for client storage are the Web Storage API (localStorage and<br />
            sessionStorage) and IndexedDB.<br />

            </h1>
            A Web filter, which is commonly referred to as "content control software",<br />
            is a piece of software designed to restrict what websites a user can visit<br />
            on his or her computer."</b> These filters can work using either a whitelist or<br />
            a blacklist: The former allows access only to sites specifically chosen by<br />
            whoever set up the filter, and the latter restricts access to undesirable<br />
            sites as determined by the standards installed in the filter. These<br />
            programs look at the URL of the desired site and search through the site's<br />
            content for restricted keywords, and then decide whether to block or allow<br />
            the connection. Filters are often installed either as a browser extension,<br />
            as a standalone program on the computer, or as part of an overall security solution.<br />
            However, they can also be installed on the network side, either by an ISP or a<br />
            business, to restrict the Web access of multiple users at once. Some search<br />
            engines also feature rudimentary filters to remove undesirable pages from search results. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Filtering Software<br />
            <br />
            Web-filtering software has two main customer bases: Parents who wish to prevent<br />
            their children from accessing content they consider undesirable or inappropriate,<br />
            and businesses that want to prevent employees from accessing websites that don't pertain<br />
            to their jobs. Web filters are also commonly used as prevention tool for malware, as the<br />
            filters will block access to sites that commonly host malware, such as those related<br />
            to pornography or gambling. The most advanced filters can even block information<br />
            that's sent out over the Internet, to ensure that sensitive data isn't released.<br />
            There are ways around web-filtering software, such as using a Web-based proxy,<br />
            using foreign-language websites or creating a VPN to a personal proxy server.<br />
            Because of these loopholes, network admins or concerned parents have to ensure that<br />
            their chosen filter can do more than just block or allow certain websites.

            </h1>
            <br />
            <b style="color:red;">THE PROBLEM WITH STRAIGHT-UP SERVLETS:</b><br />
            <br />
            <i><br />
                In the beginning, servlets were invented, and the world saw that they were good. Dynamic web pages based
                on servlets executed quickly, could be moved between servers easily, and integrated well with back-end
                data sources. Servlets became widely accepted as a premiere platform for server-side web
                development.</i><br />
            <br><br />
            <br />
            <i><br />
                However, the commonly-used simple approach to generating HTML content, having the programer write an
                out.println() call per HTML line, became a serious problem for real servlet use. HTML content had to be
                created within code, an onerous and time consuming task for long HTML pages. In addition, content
                creators had to ask developers to make all content changes. People searched for a better way.</i><br />
            <br><br />
            <b style="color:red;">ALONG COMES JSP:</b><br />
            <i><br />
                Around this time JSP 0.90 came along. With this new technology you could put snippets of Java code
                inside your HTML, and the server would automatically create a servlet from the page. This helped quite a
                lot. There was no attempt to hide the Servlet API; JSP was considered a "cheap" way for a Java
                programmer to write a servlet. All the HTML code could be included directly without out.println() calls
                and page creators could make changes to the HTML without serious risk of breaking the Java code.<br />
                <br><br />
                But having artists and developers working on the same file wasn't ideal, and having Java inside HTML
                proved almost as awkward as having HTML inside Java. It could easily create a hard to read mess.<br />
                <br><br />
                So people matured in their use of JSP and started to rely more on JavaBeans. Beans were written to
                contain business logic code needed by the JSP page. Much of the code inside the JSP page could be moved
                out of the page into the bean with only minimal hooks left behind where the page would access the
                bean.<br />
                <br><br />
                More recently, people have started to note that JSP pages used this way are really a "view". They're a
                component used to display the results of a client request. So people thought, Why submit a request
                directly to a "view"? What if the targetted "view" isn't the proper view for that request? After all,
                many requests have several possible resulting views. For example, the same request might generate a
                success page, a database exception error report, or a required parameter missing error report. The same
                request might also generate a page in English or a page in Spanish, depending on the client's locale.
                Why must a client directly submit its request to a view? Shouldn't the client make a request to some
                general server component and let the server determine the JSP view to return?<br />
                <br><br />
                This belief caused many people to adopt what has been called the "Model 2" design, named after an
                architecture laid out in the JSP 0.92 specification and based on the model-view-controller pattern. With
                this design, requests are submitted to a servlet "controller" that performs business logic and generates
                an appropriate data "model" to be displayed. This data is then passed internally to a JSP page "view"
                for rendering, where it appears to the JSP page like a normal embedded JavaBean. The appropriate JSP
                page can be selected to do the display, depending on the logic inside the controlling servlet. The JSP
                page becomes a nice template view. This was another improvement -- and where many serious developers
                stand today.<br />

            share of fiendish rogues. As companies place more and more emphasis on online commerce and begin to load
            their Intranets with sensitive information, security has become one of the most important topics in web

            • Susceptible to interception<br />
            • Susceptible to guessing<br />
             Countermeasure: account lock-out when a user fail to login after a specified number of attempts<br />
             Problem: susceptible to denial of service attack<br />
            <br />
            Servlet authentication<br />
            <br />
            Authentication is the process of being able to verify the identities of the parties involved<br />
            Four types of authentication:<br />
            <br />
             HTTP basic authentication<br />
             HTTP digest authentication<br />
             Form based authentication<br />
             SSL client authentication<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            HTTP basic authentication: <br />
             Using dialog box<br />
             Server ask browser for a username and password<br />
             Two problems<br />
             Base64-encoded<br />
             Weak security<br />
            <br />
            HTTP Digest authentication:<br />
             Using message digest to exchange information<br />
             How the protocol works<br />
            Server creates a nonce<br />
            Sends that nonce to the client<br />
            Client hashes nonce <br />
            Sends hash back to server<br />
            Server computes its own hash <br />
            Server compares the hashes<br />
             Not all browsers and servers support digest authentication<br />
            <br />
            Form based authentication:<br />
            <br />
             A standard HTML page to be used to request username and password<br />
             Not as secure as digest authentication<br />
             A cookie is set<br />
            <br />
            HTTPS Client Authentication (SSL):<br />
            <br />
             Strongest form of authentication<br />
             Simply HTTP over SSL<br />
             Requires client to have a private key and a certificate<br />
             To ensure your users has a certificate, need to either send them to a CA such as Veirsign or become your
            own CA so you can issue browser certificate<br />
             Adds considerable security<br />
            <br />
            Access control<br />
            <br />
             Servlet security model is role-based<br />
             To check whether a user has access to given resource, Server checks whether the user in any of those
            roles<br />
             Two ways to specify the roles:<br />
             Declarative <br />
             Programmatic<br />
            Declarative Security:<br />
             In the deployment descriptor specify whether a resource is protected and what roles can access it <br />
             Add security-constraint element to descriptor to prevent unauthorized users<br />
            Programmatic Security:<br />
             Three methods in javax.servlet.HttpServletRequest:<br />
             String getRemoteUser()<br />
             Boolean isUserInRole(String role)<br />
             Princippal getUserPrincipal()<br />
            <br />
            Data Integrity<br />
            <br />
             Data Integrity <br />
             A servlet container issue<br />
             Configure web server to use SSL for all connections<br />
             Being able to verify that the content of the communication is not changed during transmission<br />
            <br />
            Confidentiality<br />
            <br />
             Confidentiality<br />
             Encrypting the connection between browser and server<br />
             Ensuring that only the parties involved can understand the communication<br />
             As with data integrity SSL almost always the way to go about handling this<br />
             The ServletRequest class contains a method isSecure() determining whether a connection has taken place
            over SSL<br />

            </h1>
            <p>JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology for developing Webpages that supports dynamic content. This helps
                developers insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags, most of which start with
                <% and end with %>.</p><br />
            <p>A JavaServer Pages component is a type of Java servlet that is designed to fulfill the role of a user
                interface for a Java web application. Web developers write JSPs as text files that combine HTML or XHTML
                code, XML elements, and embedded JSP actions and commands.</p><br />
            <p>Using JSP, you can collect input from users through Webpage forms, present records from a database or
                another source, and create Webpages dynamically.</p><br />
            <p>JSP tags can be used for a variety of purposes, such as retrieving information from a database or
                registering user preferences, accessing JavaBeans components, passing control between pages, and sharing
                information between requests, pages etc.</p><br />
            <h2>Use of JSP</h2><br />
            <p>JavaServer Pages often serve the same purpose as programs implemented using the Common Gateway Interface
                (CGI). But JSP offers several advantages in comparison with the CGI.<br />
                <ul type="square"><br />
                    <li>Performance is significantly better because JSP allows embedding Dynamic Elements in HTML Pages
                        itself instead of having separate CGI files.</li><br />
                    <li>JSP are always compiled before they are processed by the server unlike CGI/Perl which requires
                        the server to load an interpreter and the target script each time the page is requested.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>JavaServer Pages are built on top of the Java Servlets API, so like Servlets, JSP also has
                        access to all the powerful Enterprise Java APIs, including JDBC, JNDI, EJB, JAXP, etc.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>JSP pages can be used in combination with servlets that handle the business logic, the model
                        supported by Java servlet template engines.</li><br />
                </ul><br />
                Finally, JSP is an integral part of Java EE, a complete platform for enterprise class applications. This
                means that JSP can play a part in the simplest applications to the most complex and demanding.<br />
            </p><br />
            <h2>Applications of JSP</h2><br />
            <p><br />
                JSP is one of the most widely used language over the web.<br><br />
                <p>
                    <h3>JSP vs. Active Server Pages (ASP)</h3><br />
                    The advantages of JSP are twofold. First, the dynamic part is written in Java, not Visual Basic or
                    other MS specific language, so it is more powerful and easier to use. Second, it is portable to
                    other operating systems and non-Microsoft Web servers.<br />
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    <h3>JSP vs. Pure Servlets</h3><br />
                    It is more convenient to write (and to modify!) regular HTML than to have plenty of println
                    statements that generate the HTML.<br />
                </p>
                <p><br />
                    <h3>JSP vs. Server-Side Includes (SSI)</h3><br />
                    SSI is really only intended for simple inclusions, not for "real" programs that use form data, make
                    database connections, and the like.<br />
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    <h3>JSP vs. JavaScript</h3><br />
                    JavaScript can generate HTML dynamically on the client but can hardly interact with the web server
                    to perform complex tasks like database access and image processing etc.<br />
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    <h3>JSP vs. Static HTML</h3><br />
                    Regular HTML, of course, cannot contain dynamic information.<br />
                </p><br />
            </p><br />
            <h1>HTTP</h1><br />
            <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is application-level protocol for collaborative, distributed,
                hypermedia information systems. It is the data communication protocol used to establish communication
                between client and server.HTTP is TCP/IP based communication protocol, which is used to deliver the data
                like image files, query results, HTML files etc on the World Wide Web (WWW) with the default port is TCP
                80. It provides the standardized way for computers to communicate with each other.<br><br />
                <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/servletpages/servletterminology/images/servlet-http4.png"
                    alt="Picture"></p><br />
            <h2>Basic Characteristics of HTTP</h2><br />
            <ul><br />
                <li>It is the protocol that allows web servers and browsers to exchange data over the web.</li><br />
                <li>It is a request response protocol.</li><br />
                <li>It uses the reliable TCP connections by default on TCP port 80.</li><br />
                <li>It is stateless means each request is considered as the new request. In other words, server doesn't
                    recognize the user by default.</li><br />
            </ul><br />
            <h2>Basic Features of HTTP</h2><br />
            <p>There are three fundamental features that make the HTTP a simple and powerful protocol used for
                communication:<br><br />
                <b>HTTP is media independent:</b> It specifies that any type of media content can be sent by HTTP as
                long as both the server and the client can handle the data content.<br><br />
                <b>HTTP is connectionless:</b> It is a connectionless approach in which HTTP client i.e., a browser
                initiates the HTTP request and after the request is sent the client disconnects from server and waits
                for the response.<br><br />
                <b>HTTP is stateless:</b> The client and server are aware of each other during a current request only.
                Afterwards, both of them forget each other. Due to the stateless nature of protocol, neither the client
                nor the server can retain the information about different request across the web pages.</p><br />
            <h2>Basic Architecture of HTTP</h2><br />
            <p>The below diagram represents the basic architecture of web application and depicts where HTTP
                stands,<br />

            </h1>
            <p>The web server needs a JSP engine, i.e, a container to process JSP pages. The JSP container is
                responsible for intercepting requests for JSP pages.A JSP container works with the Web server to provide
                the runtime environment and other services a JSP needs. It knows how to understand the special elements
                that are part of JSPs.<br>The following diagram shows the position of JSP container and JSP files in a
                Web application.<br><br />
                <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/images/jsp-arch.jpg" alt="Picture"></p><br />
            <h2>JSP Processing</h2><br />
            <p>The following steps explain how the web server creates the Webpage using JSP<br />
                <ul><br />
                    <li>As with a normal page, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.</li><br />
                    <li>The web server recognizes that the HTTP request is for a JSP page and forwards it to a JSP
                        engine. This is done by using the URL or JSP page which ends with .jsp instead of .html.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into a servlet content. This
                        conversion is very simple in which all template text is converted to println( ) statements and
                        all JSP elements are converted to Java code. This code implements the corresponding dynamic
                        behavior of the page.</li><br />
                    <li>The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and forwards the original request
                        to a servlet engine.</li><br />
                    <li>A part of the web server called the servlet engine loads the Servlet class and executes it.
                        During execution, the servlet produces an output in HTML format. The output is furthur passed on
                        to the web server by the servlet engine inside an HTTP response.</li><br />
                    <li>The web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser in terms of static HTML content.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Finally, the web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the HTTP response
                        exactly as if it were a static page.</li><br />
                </ul><br />
                <br>All the above mentioned steps can be seen in the following diagram, <br />
                <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/images/jsp-processing.jpg" alt="pic"><br />
            </p><br />
            <p>Typically, the JSP engine checks to see whether a servlet for a JSP file already exists and whether the
                modification date on the JSP is older than the servlet. If the JSP is older than its generated servlet,
                the JSP container assumes that the JSP hasn't changed and that the generated servlet still matches the
                JSP's contents. This makes the process more efficient than with the other scripting languages (such as
                PHP) and therefore faster.<br><br />
                So in a way, a JSP page is really just another way to write a servlet without having to be a Java
                programming wiz. Except for the translation phase, a JSP page is handled exactly like a regular
                servlet.</br><br />

            <h2 style="color:red;">HOW JSP WORKS ?</h2><br />
            <p>A JSP page exists in three forms:</p><br />
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li><b>JSP source code</b>- This is the form the developer actually writes. It exists in a text file
                    with an extension of <i style="color:green">.jsp</i> and consists of a mix of HTML template code,
                    Java language statements, and JSP directives and actions that describe how to generate a Web page to
                    service a particular request.</li><br />
                <li><b>Java source code</b>- The JSP container translates the JSP source code into the source code for
                    an equivalent Java servlet as needed. This source code is typically saved in a work area and is
                    often helpful for debugging.</li><br />
                <li><b>Compiled Java class</b>- Like any other Java class, the generated servlet code is compiled into
                    bytecodes in a <i style="color:green">.class</i> file, ready to be loaded and executed.</li>

            JSP PAGE<br />
            • Java Server Page (JSP) technology provides a simplified, fast way to create web pages that display
            dynamically-generated content.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            • A jsp page has the extension .jsp or .jspx.<br />
            • This signals to the web server that the jsp engine will process elements on this page.<br />
            • Using the .xtml deployment descriptor, additional extensions can be associated with the jsp engine.<br />
            JSP NOTATIONS:<br />
            • <%....%>jsp scriptlet –>a fragment of code that run when the user request the page.<br />

                An expression element contains a scripting language expression that is evaluated, converted to a string,
                and inserted where the expression appears in the JSP file.<br />
                Because the value of an expression is converted to a string, you can use an expression within a line of
                text,whether or not it is tagged with HTML,in a JSPfile. Expression are evaluated from left to
                right.<br />

            JSP<br />
            JSP stands for Java Server Page<br />
            <br />
            JSP will have the extension of .jsp<br />
            <br />
            JSP is a server side program so it has to executed on a web server or app server<br />
            <br />
            HTML+JAVA=JSP.That means jsp contains both html and java files<br />
            <br />
            JSP is used for UI/frontend/display purpose<br />
            <br />
            Servlets generally contains three files <br />
            .html file<br />
            Web.xml file<br />
            .java file<br />
            <br />
            JSP is a type of servlet in which the JSP contains all three files in one file i.e .jsp file<br />
            <br />
            JSP is a dynamic compilation, which means when a JSP is modified, it need not be compiled and restarted in
            the web server.<br />
            After modification of JSP, refresh the browser, changes will be reflected<br />
            <br />
            JSP SYNTAX<br />
            <br />
            Structure of JSP Page :<br />
            JSPs are comprised of standard HTML tags and JSP tags. The structure of JavaServer pages are simple and
            easily handled by the servlet engine. In addition to HTML ,you can categorize JSPs as following -<br />
            <br />
            Directives<br />
            Declarations<br />
            Scriptlets<br />
            Comments<br />
            Expressions<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Directives :<br />
            Directives are defined by using <%@ and %> tags.<br />
            Syntax -<br />
            <%@ directive attribute="value" %><br />
            <br />
            Declarations :<br />
            Declarations are defined by using <%! and %> tags. Whatever you declare within these tags will be visible to
            the rest of the page.<br />
            Syntax - <br />
            <%! declaration(s) %><br />
            <br />
            Scriptlets:<br />
            Scriptlets are defined by using <% and %> tags.<br />
            Syntax -<br />
            <% Scriptlets%><br />
            <br />
            Comments :<br />
            It is written by using the <%-- and --%> tags.<br />
            Syntax -<br />
            <%-- comment text --%><br />
            <br />
            Expressions :<br />
            For writing expression in JSP, you can use <%= and %> tags.<br />
            Syntax -<br />

            JSP Components<br />
            <br />
            Structure of JSP Page :<br />
            JSPs are comprised of standard HTML tags and JSP tags. The structure of JavaServer pages are simple and
            easily handled by the servlet engine. In addition to HTML ,you can categorize JSPs as following -<br />
            <br />
            Directives<br />
            Declarations<br />
            Scriptlets<br />
            Comments<br />
            Expressions<br />
            <br />
            Directives :<br />
            A directives tag always appears at the top of your JSP file. It is global definition sent to the JSP engine.
            Directives contain special processing instructions for the web container. You can import packages, define
            error handling pages or the session information of the JSP page. Directives are defined by using <%@ and %>
            tags.<br />
            Syntax -<br />
            <%@ directive attribute="value" %><br />
            <br />
            There are three types of directives:<br />
            Page directive<br />
            Include directive<br />
            Taglib directive<br />
            <br />
            JSP page directive:<br />
            The page directive defines attributes that apply to an entire JSP page<br />
            Syntax:<br />
            <%@ page attribute=”value”%><br />
            <br />
            JSP include directive:<br />
            The include directive is used to include the contents of any resource it may be JSP file, html file or text
            file. The include directive includes the original content of the included resource at page translation time
            (the jsp page is translated only once so it will be better to include static resource).<br />
            <br />
            Syntax :<br />
            <%@ include file="resourceName" %><br />
            <br />
            JSP taglib directive: <br />
            The JSP taglib directive is used to define a tag library that defines many tags. We use the TLD (Tag Library
            Descriptor) file to define the tags. In the custom tag section we will use this tag so it will be better to
            learn it in custom tag.<br />
            Syntax:<br />
            <%@ taglib uri=”urioftaglibrary” prefix=”prefixoftaglibrary”%><br />
            <br />
            EX:<br />
            <br />
            <%@page contenttype=”text/html” language=”java”%><br />
            <%@page import=”java.util.Date” session=”false"%><br />
            <br />
            Declarations :<br />
            This tag is used for defining the functions and variables to be used in the JSP. This element of JSPs
            contains the java variables and methods which you can call in expression block of JSP page. Declarations are
            defined by using <%! and %> tags. Whatever you declare within these tags will be visible to the rest of the
            page.<br />
            <br />
            Syntax - <br />
            <%! declaration(s) %><br />
            <br />
            Ex: In this example we are declaring the field<br />
            <br />
            <%! int data=50;%> <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Scriptlets:<br />
            In this tag we can insert any amount of valid java code and these codes are placed in _jspService method by
            the JSP engine. Scriptlets can be used anywhere in the page. Scriptlets are defined by using <% and %>
            tags.<br />
            Syntax -<br />
            <br />
            <% Scriptlets%><br />
            <br />
            EX:<br />
            <br />
            <%<br />
      out.print(“welcome to jsp”);<br />
      %><br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Comments :<br />
            Comments help in understanding what is actually code doing. JSPs provides two types of comments for putting
            comment in your page. First type of comment is for output comment which is appeared in the output stream on
            the browser. Second type of comment is not delivered to the browser it is written by using the <%-- and --%>
            tags.<br />
            Syntax -<br />
            <%-- comment text --%><br />
            <br />
            Ex:<br />
            <br />
            <%! int data=50;%> <%--JSP declaration--%><br />
            <%=”Value of variable is:”+data%> <%--JSP expression--%><br />
            <br />
            Expressions :<br />
            Expressions in JSPs is used to output any data on the generated page. These data are automatically converted
            to string and printed on the output stream. It is an instruction to the web container for executing the code
            with in the expression and replace it with the resultant output content. For writing expression in JSP, you
            can use <%= and %> tags.<br />
            <br />
            Syntax -<br />
            <%= expression %><br />
            <br />
            Ex: <br />
            In this example of JSP expression tag we are simply displaying a welcome message<br />
            <br />
            <%=“welcome to jsp”  %><br />

                Topic: 5.1: Beans
            </h1>
            <p> According to java white paper,it is a reusable software component.A bean encapsulates many objects into
                one object so that we can access this object from multiple places.more over,it provides easy
                maintenance,to access the java bean class we should use getter and setter methods.<br />
                java beans is a java class that should follow the following conventions:<br />
                1.It should have no-args constructor<br />
                2.It should be serializable<br />
                3.It should provide methods to set and get the values of the properties known as getter and setter
                <br />
                Java bean properties:<br />
                A java bean property is named feature that can be assessed by the user of the object the feature can be
                any java datatype containing the classes that you define<br />
                A java bean property may be read,write,read only or write only.java bean features are accessed through
                two methods in java beans implementation class.<br />
                get property name()<br />
                for ex:If the property is the name,the method name should be get first name() to read the property.this
                method <br />
                is called the acesser<br />
                set property name()<br />
                for ex:If the property name is the first name, the method name would be set first name() to write the
                <br />
                property.this method is called mutator.<br />
                Advantages of java Bean:<br />
                >the java bean properties and methods can be exposed to another application <br />
                >It provides an easiness to software components.<br />
                Disadvantages of java beans:<br />
                >Java beans are mutable.so,it can not take advantages of immutable objects.<br />
                >creating the setter and getter methods for each property separately may lead to the boilerplate
                code.<br />

            </h1>
            <p>Session simply means a particular interval of time.<br />
                <br />
                Session tracking:<br />
                Session Tracking is a way to maintain state (data) of an user. It is also known as session management in
                <br />
                servlet.<br />
                Http protocol is a stateless so we need to maintain state using session tracking techniques. Each time
                user requests to the server, server treats the request as the new request. So we need to maintain the
                state of an user to recognize to particular user<br />
                There are four techniques used in Session tracking:<br />
                1.Cookies<br />
                2.Hidden Form Field<br />
                3.URL Rewriting<br />
                4.Http Session<br />
                Cookies:<br />
                Cookies in Servlet<br />
                A cookie is a small piece of information that is persisted between the multiple client requests.<br />
                A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain
                qualifiers, a <br />
                maximum age, and a version number.<br />
                There are 2 types of cookies in servlets.<br />
                *Non-persistent cookie<br />
                *Persistent cookie<br />
                1.Non-persistent cookie:<br />
                It is valid for single session only. It is removed each time when user closes the browser.<br />
                2.Persistent cookie:<br />
                It is valid for multiple session . It is not removed each time when user closes the browser. It is
                removed only if user logout or signout.<br />
                >Advantage of Cookies:<br />
                *Simplest technique of maintaining the state.<br />
                *Cookies are maintained at client side.<br />
                >Disadvantage of Cookies<br />
                *It will not work if cookie is disabled from the browser.<br />
                *Only textual information can be set in Cookie object.<br />
                Hidden Form Field:<br />
                In case of Hidden Form Field a hidden (invisible) text field is used for maintaining the state of an
                user. In such case, we store the information in the hidden field and get it from another servlet. This
                approach is better if we have to submit form in all the pages and we don't want to depend on the
                browser.<br />
                <input type="hidden" name="username" value="Vimal Jaiswal"> <br />
                Here, username is the hidden field name and Vimal Jaiswal is the hidden field value.<br />
                Real application of hidden form field<br />
                It is widely used in comment form of a website. In such case, we store page id or page name in the
                hidden field so that each page can be uniquely identified.<br />
                >Advantage of Hidden Form Field:<br />
                *It will always work whether cookie is disabled or not.<br />
                >Disadvantage of Hidden Form Field:<br />
                *It is maintained at server side.<br />
                *Extra form submission is required on each pages.<br />
                *Only textual information can be used<br />
                Only textual information can be used.<br />
                URL rewriting:<br />
                In URL rewriting, we append a token or identifier to the URL of the next Servlet or the next resource.
                We can send parameter name/value pairs using the following format:<br />
                "url?name1=value1&name2=value2&??"<br />
                A name and a value is separated using an equal = sign, a parameter name/value pair is separated from
                another parameter using the ampersand(&). When the user clicks the hyperlink, the parameter name/value
                pairs will be passed to the server. From a Servlet, we can use get Parameter() method to obtain a
                parameter value.<br />
                >Advantage of URL Rewriting<br />
                *It will always work whether cookie is disabled or not (browser independent).<br />
                *Extra form submission is not required on each pages.<br />
                Disadvantage of URL Rewriting<br />
                *It will work only with links.<br />
                *It can send Only textual information<br />
                Http Session interface:<br />
                How to get the Http Session object<br />
                Commonly used methods of Http Session interface<br />
                Example of using Http Session:<br />
                In such case, container creates a session id for each user. The container uses this id to identify the
                particular user. An object of Http Session can be used to perform two tasks:<br />
                bind objects view and manipulate information about a session, such as the session identifier, creation
                time, and last accessed time.<br />

            </h1>
            <p>JSP is the main thing used to retrieving information from a database or registering user preferences,
                accessing JavaBeans components, passing control between pages, and sharing information between requests,
                pages<p><br />
                    <br />
                    <h2>What is JavaServer Pages?</h2><br />
                    <p>JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology for developing Webpages that supports dynamic content.
                        This helps developers insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags, most of
                        which start with <% and end with %>. A JavaServer Pages component is a type of Java servlet that
                        is designed to fulfill the role of a user interface for a Java web application. Web developers
                        write JSPs as text files that combine HTML or XHTML code, XML elements, and embedded JSP actions
                        and commands.<br />
                        Using JSP, you can collect input from users through Webpage forms, present records from a
                        database or another source, and create Webpages dynamically. JSP tags can be used for a variety
                        of purposes, such as retrieving information from a database or registering user preferences,
                        accessing JavaBeans components, passing control between pages, and sharing information between
                        requests, pages etc.</p><br />
                    <br />
                    <h2>Why Use JSP?</h2><br />
                    <p>JavaServer Pages often serve the same purpose as programs implemented using the Common Gateway
                        Interface (CGI). But JSP offers several advantages in comparison with the CGI.Performance is
                        significantly better because JSP allows embedding Dynamic Elements in HTML Pages itself instead
                        of having separate CGI files.JSP are always compiled before they are processed by the server
                        unlike CGI/Perl which requires the server to load an interpreter and the target script each time
                        the page is requested.<br><br />
                        JavaServer Pages are built on top of the Java Servlets API, so like Servlets, JSP also has
                        access to all the powerful Enterprise Java APIs, including JDBC, JNDI, EJB, JAXP, etc. JSP pages
                        can be used in combination with servlets that handle the business logic, the model supported by
                        Java servlet template engines. Finally, JSP is an integral part of Java EE, a complete platform
                        for enterprise class applications. This means that JSP can play a part in the simplest
                        applications to the most complex and demanding.</p><br />
                    <br />
                    <h2>Advantages of JSP</h2><br />
                    <p>Following table lists out the other advantages of using JSP over other technologies −<br><br />
                        <br />
                        vs. Active Server Pages (ASP)<br><br />
                        The advantages of JSP are twofold. First, the dynamic part is written in Java, not Visual Basic
                        or other MS specific language, so it is more powerful and easier to use. Second, it is portable
                        to other operating systems and non-Microsoft Web servers.<br><br />
                        <br />
                        vs. Pure Servlets<br><br />
                        It is more convenient to write (and to modify!) regular HTML than to have plenty of println
                        statements that generate the HTML.<br><br />
                        <br />
                        vs. Server-Side Includes (SSI)<br><br />
                        SSI is really only intended for simple inclusions, not for "real" programs that use form data,
                        make database connections, and the like.<br><br />
                        <br />
                        vs. JavaScript<br><br />
                        JavaScript can generate HTML dynamically on the client but can hardly interact with the web
                        server to perform complex tasks like database access and image processing etc.<br><br />
                        <br />
                        vs. Static HTML<br><br />
                        Regular HTML, of course, cannot contain dynamic information.<br />

            <p><br />
                HTTP is a stateless, request-response protocol. This means that the browser sends a request for a web
                resource, and the web server processes the request and returns a response. The server then forgets this
                transaction ever happened. So when the same browser sends a new request, the web server has no idea that
                this request is related to the previous one. This is fine if you’re dealing with static files, but it’s
                a problem in an interactive web application. In a travel agency application, for instance, it’s
                important to remember the dates and destination entered to book the flight so the customer doesn’t have
                to enter the same information again when it’s time to make hotel and rental car reservations.<br />
                <br />
                The way to solve this problem is to let the server send a piece of information to the browser that the
                browser then includes in all subsequent requests. This piece of information, called a session ID, is
                used by the server to recognize a set of requests from the same browser as related: in other words, as
                part of the same session. A session starts when the browser makes the first request for a JSP page in a
                particular application. The session can be ended explicitly by the application, or the JSP container can
                end it after a period of user inactivity (the default value is typically 30 minutes after the last
                request).<br />
                Thanks to the session ID, the server knows that all requests from the same browser are related.

            <p>Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for the<br />
                programming language Java, which defines how a client<br />
                may access any kind of tabular data, especially relational database.<br />
                It is part of Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation. It acts as a middle <br />
                layer interface between java applications and database.<br />
                <br><br><br />
                The JDBC classes are contained in the Java Package java.sql and javax.sql.<br />
                JDBC helps you to write Java applications that manage these three programming activities:<br />
                <br />
                <br>1.Connect to a data source, like a database.<br><br />
                2.Send queries and update statements to the database<br><br />
                3.Retrieve and process the results received from the database in answer to your query<br><br />

                <p>JDBC Driver is a software component that enables java application to interact with the database.
                    There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:<br />
                    <br>1.JDBC-ODBC bridge driver<br />
                    <br>2.Native-API driver (partially java driver)<br />
                    <br>3.Network Protocol driver (fully java driver)<br />
                    <br>4.Thin driver (fully java driver)</p><br />
                <h3>1)JDBC-ODBC bridge driver:</h3><br />
                <p>JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses ODBC driver to connect to <br />
                    the database. The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function
                    calls.<br />
                    Type-1 driver is also called Universal driver because it can be used to connect to any of the
                    databases.</p><br />
                <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/type11.JPG" width="350" height="300"
                    style="margin-left:200px"><br />
                <p>1.As a common driver is used in order to interact with different databases, the data transferred
                    through this driver is not so secured.<br />
                    <br>2.The ODBC bridge driver is needed to be installed in individual client machines.<br />
                    <br>3.Type-1 driver isn’t written in java, that’s why it isn’t a portable driver.<br />
                    <br>4.This driver software is built-in with JDK so no need to install separately.<br />
                    <br>5.It is a database independent driver.</p><br />
                <h3>2)Native-API driver</h3><br />
                <p>The Native API driver uses the client -side libraries of the database. This driver converts JDBC
                    method calls<br />
                    into native calls of the database API. In order to interact with different database,<br />
                    this driver needs their local API, that’s why data transfer is much more secure as compared to
                    type-1 driver.</p><br />
                <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/type12.JPG" width="350" height="300"
                    style="margin-left:200px"><br />
                <p>1.Driver needs to be installed separately in individual client machines<br />
                    <br>2.The Vendor client library needs to be installed on client machine.<br />
                    <br>3.Type-2 driver isn’t written in java, that’s why it isn’t a portable driver<br />
                    <br>4.It is a database dependent driver.</p><br />
                <h3>3)Network Protocol driver</h3><br />
                <p>The Network Protocol driver uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC calls directly or
                    indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol.<br />
                    Here all the database connectivity drivers are present in a single server, hence no need of
                    individual client-side installation.</p><br />
                <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/type13.JPG" width="350" height="300"
                    style="margin-left:200px"><br />
                <p>1.Type-3 drivers are fully written in Java, hence they are portable drivers.<br />
                    <br>2.No client side library is required because of application server that can perform many tasks
                    like auditing, load balancing, logging etc.<br />
                    <br>3.Network support is required on client machine.<br />
                    <br>4.Maintenance of Network Protocol driver becomes costly because it requires database-specific
                    coding to be done in the middle tier.<br />
                    <br>5.Switch facility to switch over from one database to another database.<br />
                </p><br />
                <h3>4)Thin driver</h3><br />
                <p>Type-4 driver is also called native protocol driver. This driver interact directly with database.
                    <br />
                    It does not require any native database library, <br />
                    that is why it is also known as Thin Driver.</p><br />
                <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/type14.JPG" width="350" height="300"
                    style="margin-left:200px"><br />
                <p>1.Does not require any native library and Middleware server, so no client-side or server-side
                    installation.<br />
                    <br>2.t is fully written in Java language, hence they are portable drivers.</p><br />
                <h3>Which Driver to use When?</h3><br />
                <p>1.If you are accessing one type of database, such as Oracle, Sybase, or IBM, the preferred driver
                    type is type-4.<br />
                    <br>2.If your Java application is accessing multiple types of databases at the same time, type 3 is
                    the preferred driver.<br />
                    <br>3.Type 2 drivers are useful in situations, where a type 3 or type 4 driver is not available yet
                    for your database.<br />
                    <br>4.The type 1 driver is not considered a deployment-level driver, and is typically used for
                    development and testing purposes only.<br />

            </h1>
            Loading the Driver<br />
            Before you can connect to a database, you need to load the driver. There are two methods available, and it
            depends on your code which is the best one to use.<br />
            <br />
            In the first method, your code implicitly loads the driver using the Class.forName() method. For
            PostgreSQL™, you would use:<br />
            <br />
            Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");<br />
            This will load the driver, and while loading, the driver will automatically register itself with JDBC.<br />
            Note<br />
            The forName() method can throw a ClassNotFoundException if the driver is not available.<br />
            <br />
            This is the most common method to use, but restricts your code to use just PostgreSQL™. If your code may
            access another database system in the future, and you do not use any PostgreSQL™-specific extensions, then
            the second method is advisable.<br />
            <br />
            The second method passes the driver as a parameter to the JVM as it starts, using the -D argument.
            Example:<br />
            <br />
            java -Djdbc.drivers=org.postgresql.Driver example.ImageViewer<br />
            In this example, the JVM will attempt to load the driver as part of its initialization. Once done, the
            ImageViewer is started.<br />
            Now, this method is the better one to use because it allows your code to be used with other database
            packages without recompiling the code. The only thing that would also change is the connection URL, which is
            covered next.<br />
            <br />
            One last thing: When your code then tries to open a Connection, and you get a No driver available
            SQLException being thrown, this is probably caused by the driver not being in the class path, or the value
            in the parameter not being correct.

                Topic: 5.9: Making a connection
            </h1>
            Connecting to the Database<br />
            With JDBC, a database is represented by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). With PostgreSQL™, this takes one
            of the following forms:<br />
            <br />
            jdbc:postgresql:database<br />
            jdbc:postgresql://host/database<br />
            jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database<br />
            The parameters have the following meanings:<br />
            host<br />
            The host name of the server. Defaults to localhost. To specify an IPv6 address your must enclose the host
            parameter with square brackets, for example:<br />
            <br />
            jdbc:postgresql://[::1]:5740/accounting<br />
            port<br />
            The port number the server is listening on. Defaults to the PostgreSQL™ standard port number (5432).<br />
            <br />
            database<br />
            The database name.<br />
            <br />
            To connect, you need to get a Connection instance from JDBC. To do this, you use the
            DriverManager.getConnection() method:<br />
            <br />
            Connection db = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);<br />
            Connection Parameters<br />
            In addition to the standard connection parameters the driver supports a number of additional properties
            which can be used to specify additional driver behavior specific to PostgreSQL™. These properties may be
            specified in either the connection URL or an additional Properties object parameter to
            DriverManager.getConnection. The following examples illustrate the use of both methods to establish a SSL
            connection.<br />
            <br />
            String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test";<br />
            Properties props = new Properties();<br />
            props.setProperty("user","fred");<br />
            props.setProperty("password","secret");<br />
            props.setProperty("ssl","true");<br />
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, props);<br />
            String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test?user=fred&password=secret&ssl=true";<br />
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);<br />
            user = String<br />
            The database user on whose behalf the connection is being made.<br />
            <br />
            password = String<br />
            The database user's password.<br />
            <br />
            ssl<br />
            Connect using SSL. The driver must have been compiled with SSL support. This property does not need a value
            associated with it. The mere presence of it specifies a SSL connection. However, for compatibility with
            future versions, the value "true" is preferred. For more information see Chapter 4, Using SSL.<br />
            <br />
            sslfactory = String<br />
            The provided value is a class name to use as the SSLSocketFactory when establishing a SSL connection. For
            more information see the section called “Custom SSLSocketFactory”.<br />
            <br />
            sslfactoryarg = String<br />
            This value is an optional argument to the constructor of the sslfactory class provided above. For more
            information see the section called “Custom SSLSocketFactory”.<br />
            <br />
            compatible = String<br />
            Act like an older version of the driver to retain compatibility with older applications. At the moment this
            controls two driver behaviors, the connection protocol and the handling of binary data fields.<br />
            <br />
            Older versions of the driver used this property to also control the protocol used to connect to the backend.
            This is now controlled by the protocolVersion property.<br />
            <br />
            Information on binary data handling is detailed in Chapter 7, Storing Binary Data. To force the use of Large
            Objects set the compatible property to 7.1.<br />
            <br />
            protocolVersion = String<br />
            The driver supports both the V2 and V3 frontend/backend protocols. The V3 protocol was introduced in 7.4 and
            the driver will by default try to connect using the V3 protocol, if that fails it will fall back to the V2
            protocol. If the protocolVersion property is specified, the driver will try only the specified protocol
            (which should be either "2" or "3"). Setting protocolVersion to "2" may be used to avoid the failed attempt
            to use the V3 protocol when connecting to a version 7.3 or earlier server, or to force the driver to use the
            V2 protocol despite connecting to a 7.4 or greater server.<br />
            <br />
            loglevel = int<br />
            Set the amount of logging information printed to the DriverManager's current value for LogStream or
            LogWriter. It currently supports values of org.postgresql.Driver.DEBUG (2) and org.postgresql.Driver.INFO
            (1). INFO will log very little information while DEBUG will produce significant detail. This property is
            only really useful if you are a developer or are having problems with the driver.<br />
            <br />
            charSet = String<br />
            The character set to use for data sent to the database or recieved from the database. This property is only
            relevent for server versions less than or equal to 7.2. The 7.3 release was the first with multibyte support
            compiled by default and the driver uses its character set translation facilities instead of trying to do it
            itself.<br />
            <br />
            allowEncodingChanges = boolean<br />
            When using the V3 protocol the driver monitors changes in certain server configuration parameters that
            should not be touched by end users. The client_encoding setting is set by the driver and should not be
            altered. If the driver detects a change it will abort the connection. There is one legitimate exception to
            this behavior though, using the COPY command on a file residing on the server's filesystem. The only means
            of specifying the encoding of this file is by altering the client_encoding setting. The JDBC team considers
            this a failing of the COPY command and hopes to provide an alternate means of specifying the encoding in the
            future, but for now there is this URL parameter. Enable this only if you need to override the client
            encoding when doing a copy.<br />
            <br />
            prepareThreshold = int<br />
            Determine the number of PreparedStatement executions required before switching over to use server side
            prepared statements. The default is five, meaning start using server side prepared statements on the fifth
            execution of the same PreparedStatement object. More information on server side prepared statements is
            available in the section called “Server Prepared Statements”.<br />
            <br />
            loginTimeout = int<br />
            Specify how long to wait for establishment of a database connection. The timeout is specified in seconds.

                Topic: 5.12: Retrieving the result
            </h1>
            Retrieving the results<br />
            Once the Hibernate Search query is built, executing it is in no way different than executing a HQL or
            Criteria query. The same paradigm and object semantic applies. All the common operations are available:
            list(), uniqueResult(), iterate(), scroll().<br />
            <br />
            5.2.1. Performance considerations<br />
            If you expect a reasonable number of results (for example using pagination) and expect to work on all of
            them, list() or uniqueResult() are recommended. list() work best if the entity batch-size is set up
            properly. Note that Hibernate Search has to process all Lucene Hits elements (within the pagination) when
            using list() , uniqueResult() and iterate().<br />
            <br />
            If you wish to minimize Lucene document loading, scroll() is more appropriate. Don't forget to close the
            ScrollableResults object when you're done, since it keeps Lucene resources. If you expect to use scroll, but
            wish to load objects in batch, you can use query.setFetchSize(). When an object is accessed, and if not
            already loaded, Hibernate Search will load the next fetchSize objects in one pass.<br />
            <br />
            Pagination is a preferred method over scrolling though.<br />
            <br />
            5.2.2. Result size<br />
            It is sometime useful to know the total number of matching documents:<br />
            <br />
            for the Google-like feature 1-10 of about 888,000,000<br />
            <br />
            to implement a fast pagination navigation<br />
            <br />
            to implement a multi step search engine (adding approximation if the restricted query return no or not
            enough results)<br />
            <br />
            Of course it would be too costly to retrieve all the matching documents. Hibernate Search allows you to
            retrieve the total number of matching documents regardless of the pagination parameters. Even more
            interesting, you can retrieve the number of matching elements without triggering a single object load.<br />
            <br />
            Example 5.11. Determining the result size of a query<br />
            <br />
            org.hibernate.search.FullTextQuery query = s.createFullTextQuery( luceneQuery, Book.class );<br />
            assert 3245 == query.getResultSize(); //return the number of matching books without loading a single
            one<br />
            <br />
            org.hibernate.search.FullTextQuery query = s.createFullTextQuery( luceneQuery, Book.class );<br />
            query.setMaxResult(10);<br />
            List results = query.list();<br />
            assert 3245 == query.getResultSize(); //return the total number of matching books regardless of
            pagination<br />
            <br />
            Note<br />
            Like Google, the number of results is approximative if the index is not fully up-to-date with the database
            (asynchronous cluster for example).<br />
            <br />
            5.2.3. ResultTransformer<br />
            Especially when using projection, the data structure returned by a query (an object array in this case), is
            not always matching the application needs. It is possible to apply a ResultTransformer operation post query
            to match the targeted data structure:<br />
            <br />
            Example 5.12. Using ResultTransformer in conjunction with projections<br />
            <br />
            org.hibernate.search.FullTextQuery query = s.createFullTextQuery( luceneQuery, Book.class );<br />
            query.setProjection( "title", "mainAuthor.name" );<br />
            <br />
            query.setResultTransformer( <br />
            new StaticAliasToBeanResultTransformer( BookView.class, "title", "author" ) <br />
            );<br />
            List<BookView> results = (List<BookView>) query.list();<br />
                    for(BookView view : results) {<br />
                    log.info( "Book: " + view.getTitle() + ", " + view.getAuthor() );<br />
                    }<br />
                    <br />
                    Examples of ResultTransformer implementations can be found in the Hibernate Core codebase.<br />
                    <br />
                    5.2.4. Understanding results<br />
                    You will find yourself sometimes puzzled by a result showing up in a query or a result not showing
                    up in a query. Luke is a great tool to understand those mysteries. However, Hibernate Search also
                    gives you access to the Lucene Explanation object for a given result (in a given query). This class
                    is considered fairly advanced to Lucene users but can provide a good understanding of the scoring of
                    an object. You have two ways to access the Explanation object for a given result:<br />
                    <br />
                    Use the fullTextQuery.explain(int) method<br />
                    <br />
                    Use projection<br />
                    <br />
                    The first approach takes a document id as a parameter and return the Explanation object. The
                    document id can be retrieved using projection and the FullTextQuery.DOCUMENT_ID constant.<br />
                    <br />
                    Warning<br />
                    The Document id has nothing to do with the entity id. Do not mess up these two notions.<br />
                    <br />
                    The second approach let's you project the Explanation object using the FullTextQuery.EXPLANATION
                    constant.<br />
                    <br />
                    Example 5.13. Retrieving the Lucene Explanation object using projection<br />
                    <br />
                    FullTextQuery ftQuery = s.createFullTextQuery( luceneQuery, Dvd.class )<br />
                    .setProjection( FullTextQuery.DOCUMENT_ID, FullTextQuery.EXPLANATION, FullTextQuery.THIS );<br />
                    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") List<Object[]> results = ftQuery.list();<br />
                        for (Object[] result : results) {<br />
                        Explanation e = (Explanation) result[1];<br />
                        display( e.toString() );<br />
                        }

                Topic: 5.13: Getting database information
            </h1>
            Getting Information About Databases and Tables:<br />
            <br />
            What if you forget the name of a database or table, or what the structure of a given table is (for example,
            what its columns are called)? MySQL addresses this problem through several statements that provide
            information about the databases and tables it supports.<br />
            <br />
            To find out which database is currently selected, use the DATABASE() function:<br />
            <br />
            mysql> SELECT DATABASE();<br />
            +------------+<br />
            | DATABASE() |<br />
            +------------+<br />
            | menagerie |<br />
            +------------+<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            If you have not yet selected any database, the result is NULL.<br />
            <br />
            To find out what tables the default database contains (for example, when you are not sure about the name of
            a table), use this statement:<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            mysql> SHOW TABLES;<br />
            +---------------------+<br />
            | Tables_in_menagerie |<br />
            +---------------------+<br />
            | event |<br />
            | pet |<br />
            +---------------------+<br />
            <br />
            The name of the column in the output produced by this statement is always Tables_in_db_name, where db_name
            is the name of the database. <br />
            <br />
            If you want to find out about the structure of a table, the DESCRIBE statement is useful; it displays
            information about each of a table's columns:<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            mysql> DESCRIBE pet;<br />
            +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+<br />
            | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |<br />
            +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+<br />
            | name | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL | |<br />
            | owner | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL | |<br />
            | species | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL | |<br />
            | sex | char(1) | YES | | NULL | |<br />
            | birth | date | YES | | NULL | |<br />
            | death | date | YES | | NULL | |<br />
            +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Field indicates the column name, Type is the data type for the column, NULL indicates whether the column can
            contain NULL values, Key indicates whether the column is indexed, and Default specifies the column's default
            value. Extra displays special information about columns: If a column was created with the AUTO_INCREMENT
            option, the value will be auto_increment rather than empty.<br />
            <br />
            DESC is a short form of DESCRIBE. <br />
            <br />
            If you have indexes on a table, SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name produces information about them.

                Topic: 5.14: Scrollable and updatable result set
            </h1>
            Result Set:<br />
            <br />
            The ResultSet is an interface defined in the java.sql package. It represents a table of data returned by a
            Statement object. A Statement object is used to execute SQL queries to the database. The ResultSet object
            maintains a cursor pointing to the current record in the database table. As a result, it can be effectively
            used to position at different rows, back and forth using first(), previous(), next(), and last() methods as
            per requirements. Initially, the ResultSet object is positioned at a location before the first row. <br />
            <br />
            What is Scrollable and Updatable ResultSet ?<br />
            <br />
            Until the release of JDBC2.1 the virtual curser could only be moved down the ResultSet object. But now the
            virtual cursor can be moved backwords or even positioned at a specific row.Also we can modify the values of
            resultset.<br />
            <br />
            The createStatement() method can take two arguments.<br />
            <br />
            The first argument can be:<br />
            TYPE_FOREWARD_ONLY <br />
            TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE <br />
            TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE <br />
            <br />
            •The TYPE_FOREWARD_ONLY constant restricts the cursor in previous direction which is the default
            setting.<br />
            <br />
            •The TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE and TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE permit the virtual cursor in both directions. <br />
            <br />
            •But the difference is TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE does not reflect changes made to the underlying data source
            while it is open, but reflects it later.<br />
            <br />
            The second argument can be:<br />
            CONCUR_UPDATABLE<br />
            CONCUR_READ_ONLY<br />
            <br />
            •Three ways in which a ResultSet can be changed, by updating value of a row, by deleting a row and by
            inserting a new row. Once we get the ResultSet the updateXXX() method is used to change the value of a row
            of ResultSet.<br />
            <br />
            •This method takes two arguments, first either the name or number of the column of the ResultSet thst is to
            be updated and the second is the new value that will replace the old.<br />
            <br />
            •The value can be set to null by calling updateNull() method. It requires one parameter which is number of
            the column in the current row of the ResultSet.<br />
            <br />
            •The updateRow() method is called after updateXXX() method. It changes the values of the column of current
            row based on the values of updateXXX() method.<br />
            <br />
            •The deleteRow() method is used to delete a row.<br />
            <br />
            •To insert a new row moveToInsertRow() method is there. After that we have to set all the fields by
            updateXXX() method. After that insertRow() should be called to insert the row.<br />
            <br />
            •There are other methods of ResultSet object that are used to position the virtual cursor in addition to
            next().<br />
            <br />
            Those are<br />
            • first()- moves the curser to first row.<br />
            • last()- moves the curser to the last row.<br />
            • previous()-moves the curser to the previous row.<br />
            • absolute()-moves to a specific row as the parameter passed<br />
            • relative()-moves to a row relative to another row<br />
            • getRow()-returns the current row number.<br />
            <br />
            Find whether ResultSet is scrollable:<br />
            •Some JDBC drivers may not support all these features and therefore they are unable to return a scrollable
            ResultSet.<br />
            <br />
            To know about it,<br />
            boolean forward,sensitive,insensitive;<br />
            Forward=DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetType(TYPE_FOREWARD_ONLY);<br />
            sensitive=DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetType(TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE);<br />
            Forward=DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetType(TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE);<br />
            <br />
            Another way to know it:<br />
            Int type=ResultSet.getType();<br />
            1003-ResultSet.TYPE_FOREWARD_ONLY<br />
            1004-ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE<br />
            1005-ResultSet.TYEP_SCROLL_SENSITIVE<br />
            <br />
            Find whether ResultSet is updatable:<br />
            Int concurrency=ResultSet.getConcurrency();<br />
            1007-ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY<br />
            1008-ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE<br />

            </h1>
            <p><br />
                One of the most important topics in the software component model is <b> reusability.</b> Writing
                self-contained software under the motto of “Developed them once, run and reuse them everywhere” is most
                required and appreciated. So reusability is added into the Java programming language with the help of
                JavaBeans.<br /><br />
                <br />
                JavaBeans are introduced in <b>1996 by Sun Microsystem </b>and defined as<br /><br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <mark>“A JavaBean is reusable, platform independent component that can be manipulated visually in a
                    builder tool.”</mark><br /><br />
                <br />
                <br />
                In simple terms, JavaBeans are classes which encapsulate several objects into a single object. It helps
                in accessing these object from multiple places. JavaBeans contains several elements like Constructors,
                Getter/Setter Methods and much more.<br /><br />
                <br />
                A JavaBean is a Java class that should follow the following conventions:<br /><br />
                <br />
                <br />
                1) It should have a no-arg constructor.<br /><br />
                <br />
                2) It should be Serializable.<br /><br />
                <br />
                3) It should provide methods to set and get the values of the properties, known as getter and setter
                methods.<br /><br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Example:</b><br />
                <br />
                All Swing and AWT classes are JavaBeans. GUI components are ideal JavaBeans.<br />
                <br /><br />
                <br />
                <b>COMPONENTS OF JAVABEANS:</b><br /><br />
                <br />
                The classes that contained definition of beans is known as components of JavaBeans. These classes
                follows certain design conventions. It includes properties, events, methods and persistence. There are
                two types of components, GUI based and non GUI based. For instance JButton is example of a component not
                a class.<br />
                <br /><br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Properties (date members):</b> Property is a named attribute of a bean, it includes color, label,
                font, font size, display size. It determines appearance, behavior and state of a bean.<br /><br />
                <br />
                <b>Methods: </b>Methods in JavaBeans are same as normal Java methods in a class. It doesn’t follow any
                specific naming conventions. All properties should have accessor and getter methods.<br /><br />
                <br />
                <b>Events:</b> Events in JavaBeans are same as SWING/AWT event handling.<br /><br />
                <br />
                <b>Persistence:</b> Serializable interface enables JavaBean to store its state.<br /><br />

            <br />
            <br />
            The Bean Builder is a tool which allows the visual assembly of an application by instantiating and setting
            the properties of components based on the JavaBeans component architecture (beans). The dynamic behavior of
            the application is specified by "wiring" relationships that represent events handlers and method calls
            between the objects in an application. The state of this application is saved to and restored from an XML
            format. An application is constructed using the Java API without having to write a line of source
            code.<br />
            <br />
            Let Us Understand more about Bean Builder by creating a simple application<br />
            <br />
            Let’s create an application that builds a simple entry list. While trivial in functionality, this
            application touches upon most of the features in the Bean Builder. Entering text and pressing return field
            appends the text to the list. The Remove All button removes all the items from the list.<br />
            Creating User Interface<br />
            <br />
            Objects are retrieved from the Palette below the toolbar. The default palette is loaded with Swing
            components and containers arranged alphabetically from left to right. The Palette is specified as an
            external XML document and can be edited. The default palette is named palette.xml.<br />
            Instantiating the First Component: The JScrollPane<br />
            <br />
            1. Select the JScrollPane on the Containers tab.<br />
            Notice that the cursor changes to a crosshair<br />
            2. Click and drag a rectangle onto the design panel.<br />
            An empty JScrollPane should appear and the cursor returns to a pointer.<br />
            Instantiating the Rest of the Components<br />
            <br />
            1. Instantiate the JLabel, JTextField and JButton components by selecting them from the Palette and then
            clicking in the Designer.<br />
            Make sure that the components are sized according to their default preferred size.<br />
            If the component appears to be very small then that indicates that you set the preferred size by clicking
            and dragging an instantiation rectangle. Delete the component by selecting it and pressing the Delete key
            and then try to instantiate the component again.<br />
            2. Instantiate the JList inside the JScrollPane by clicking inside the JScrollPane in the Designer.<br />
            It's very important for scrollable components like JList to adhere to its preferred size while in the
            JScrollPane.<br />
            Setting Object Properties<br />
            The instantiated objects have the default properties when the default constructor on the Class is invoked.
            Properties that conform to the JavaBeans specification method signatures for getters and setters are exposed
            and may be set to give the object a distinct identity.<br />
            For example, some visual properties on Components that can be set include the font, colors, sizing and
            alignment characteristics.<br />
            <br />
            Now set the properties to all based on requirement<br />
            <br />
            1. Select the JButton object as the current object and change the label property to "Remove All".<br />
            2. Change the name of the JLabel object to "Add: " by changing its text property<br />
            3. Increase the value of the JLabel object's font property to 18 point using the font PropertyEditor.<br />
            4. Set the horizontalAlignment of the label to be right justified by selecting "RIGHT" using the alignment
            combo box.<br />
            <br />
            Creating a Non-visual Bean<br />
            The model view controller (MVC) architecture of the JFC components requires a model that acts as an
            intermediary between the user interaction and the data. For this example we set the model of the JList
            object to use a DefaultListModel.<br />
            The DefaultListModel is a non-visual bean - a bean that doesn't inherit from java.awt.Component<br />
            The Control Panel<br />
            <br />
            The modes of the builder and designer are controlled with this interface. The combo box on the left toggles
            the designer between two modes:<br />
            • Event Management allows editing of dynamic interactions between objects.<br />
            • Layout Editing allows the editing of the resizing behavior between objects.<br />
            The check box on the right toggles the designer on or off. If the designer is off then the designed
            application is "live".<br />
            First we have to create a new instance of the DefaultListModel and place it on the design panel for
            manipulation.<br />
            <br />
            1. Put the cursor focus in the Instantiate Bean text field (try alt-b)<br />
            2. Enter the following string: javax.swing.DefaultListModel.<br />
            3. Press the Enter key to create a new instance<br />
            A visual proxy object that represents the non-visual bean appears in the upper left of the Designer and is
            the selected object. Notice that the containment hierarchy doesn't show the same selection. The hierarchy
            only displays containment relationships.<br />
            This visual proxy object is used to select and hookup the non-visual Object that it wraps. You can move the
            visual proxy object by dragging on the center handle but you cannot resize the visual proxy.<br />
            The Instantiate Bean field is used to instantiate any object from a class that is found in the
            classpath.<br />
            Setting an Object as a Property of Another Object<br />
            The newly instantiated DefaultListModel is in the design but is not associated with an object. This model
            should be associated with the JList object in the user interface. Use the Interaction Wizard to define the
            way that objects relate to each other. The interaction is going to take a source object and set it as a
            property value on the target object using a setter method from the target. This means that we want to call
            the JList.setModel(...) method with the list model as the argument.<br />
            <br />
            1. Click on any one of the four connection handles surrounding the DefaultListModel instance and drag the
            mouse over to a connection handle surrounding the JScrollPane object.<br />
            Notice that a line is drawn between the list model and the JScrollPane object. The cursor changes to a
            crosshair when it is over the connection handle.<br />
            2. Release the mouse over the JScrollPane connection handle.<br />
            A popup menu appears that has all the components in the inheritance hierarchy of the JScrollPane.<br />
            3. Select the JList from the popup menu and the Interaction Wizard appears<br />
            <br />
            4. Select the Set Property radio button and the Wizard reconfigures itself for property association.<br />
            The items in the list are target object methods whose parameter matches the type of the source object or can
            be related by an isAssignableFrom inheritance relationship.<br />
            Select the "model( ListModel )" list item and select the Finish button.<br />
            The Interaction Wizard is dismissed and the DefaultListModel instance is used as the model for the JList
            object. You can verify this by selecting the JList object in the containment hierarchy and looking at the
            model property in the property sheet. 5. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Creating Event Adapters<br />
            The traditional way of creating an event interaction between two objects was to create a small inner class
            and recompile it.<br />
            This builder uses the Dynamic Proxy API to create EventHandler objects that are event listeners. This API
            was added to release 1.3 and are used to synthesize listeners of arbitrary types at runtime. The advantage
            of using the Dynamic Proxy API is that it avoids costly inner classes and you can dynamically create these
            listener classes without having to recompile code.<br />
            We are now going to add two EventHandlers that implement the following behavior:<br />
            • Pressing Enter in the text field adds the contents of the text field to the list model (and therefore,
            adds the item to the list)<br />
            • Pressing the "Remove All" button removes all the items in the list model (and therefore, it removes them
            all from the list)<br />
            <br />
            1. Click on a JTextField connection handle and drag the cursor to a DefaultListModel connection handle. The
            Interaction Wizard appears.<br />
            2. Select the Event Adapter radio button in the Interaction Wizard<br />
            The Wizard reconfigures itself for generating an event adapter. Notice that the Finish button is disabled
            and the Next button is enabled. This indicates that there are more steps to create the adapter.<br />
            <br />
            3. Select the "action" item in the "Event Sets" list and select the Next button<br />
            The page of the Wizard apears that allow the selection of a target method on the DefaultListModel instance.
            As a simplification, only target methods that require one or zero arguments are listed.<br />
            4. Select the "addElement( Object )" item in the "Target Methods" list and select the Next button<br />
            The third panel is a list of no argument methods retrieved from the source object that return the same type
            that the target method requires as an argument. This allows adapters that get generated that use
            target.setFoo(source.getBar);<br />
            Select the "getText( )" item in the "Source Methods" list and select the Finish button.<br />
            A new EventHandler is created that adds the string in the JTextField to the list as a result of the
            actionPerformed method when the Enter key is pressed. The EventHandler is created with the Dynamic Proxy
            APIs that were introduced in release 1.3. 5. <br />
            Creating Another Event Adapter<br />
            Create a new event adapter for the JButton using the Interaction Wizard.<br />
            This interaction deletes all the items in the list when the "Remove All" button is pressed. Repeat the same
            steps using the wizard with the following values:<br />
            • Source Object: JButton<br />
            • Target Object: DefaultListModel<br />
            • Source Method: actionPerformed( ActionEvent )<br />
            • Target Method: removeAllElements( )<br />
            Testing the Runtime Application<br />
            The event adapters and property associations are created and linked for "live" objects. You may test the
            live object graph by taking the Bean Builder out of Design Mode and putting it into Runtime Mode. You can
            switch between these two states by selecting or de-selecting the Design Mode checkbox (alt-d). This Action
            is mirrored on the View menu.<br />
            In Runtime Mode, the objects on the design panel become "live". The application behaves the exactly the way
            that it was designed.<br />
            Type some values in the text field and press the Enter key at the end of each string. These values appear in
            the list. Pressing the "Remove All" button clears the list.<br />

                Topic: 5.18: Advantages of Java Beans
            </h1>
            <p><br />
                JavaBeans is a portable, platform-independent component model written in the Java programming language.
                The JavaBeans architecture was built through a collaborative industry effort and enables developers to
                write reusable components in the Java programming language. JavaBean components are known as beans.
                Beans are dynamic ,in that they can be changed or customized.<br />
            </p><br />
            <p><br />
                <b>Advantages of Java Beans </b><br />
                Software component architecture provides standard mechanisms to deal with software building blocks. The
                following list enumerates some of the specific benefits that Java technology provides for a component
                developer.<br />
            </p><br />
            <p><br />
                1)A Bean obtains all the benefits of Java's "write-once, run-anywhere" paradigm.<br> <br />
                2)The properties, events, and methods of a Bean that are exposed to an application<br />
                builder tool can be controlled.<br><br />
                3)A Bean may be designed to operate correctly in different locales, which makes it<br />
                useful in global markets.<br />
                Auxiliary software can be provided to help a person configure a Bean. This software is only needed when
                the design-time parameters for that component are being set.<br><br />
                4)It does not need to be included in the run-time environment.<br><br />
                5)The configuration settings of a Bean can be saved in persistent storage and restored at a later
                time.<br><br />
                6)A Bean may register to receive events from other objects and can generate events that are sent to
                other objects.<br />

                Topic: 5.19: BDK introspection
            </h1>
            In this section we discuss about BDK introspection .Before that we need to understand Beans Development
            Kit<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Beans Development Kit<br />
            <br />
            1. Beans Development Kit is an application builder tool that enables you to create, configure, and connect a
            set of JavaBeans.<br />
            2.It is developed by Sun Micro Systems.<br />
            3.It is intended to support the early development of JavaBeans components and to act as a standard reference
            base for both component developers and tool vendors.<br />
            Features of BDK:<br />
            *Provides a GUI to create, configure, and test JavaBeans.<br />
            *Enables you to modify JavaBean properties and link multiple JavaBeans in an application.<br />
            *Provides a set of sample JavaBeans.<br />
            *Enables you to associate pre-defined events with sample JavaBeans.<br />
            The components of BDK development environment are:<br />
            1. ToolBox<br />
            2. BeanBox<br />
            3. Properties<br />
            4. Method Tracer<br />
            <br />
            ToolBox window: Lists the sample JavaBeans of BDK<br />
            BeanBox window: Is a workspace for creating the layout of JavaBean application.<br />
            Properties window: Displays all the exposed properties of a JavaBean. You can modify JavaBean properties in
            the properties window.<br />
            Method Tracer window: Displays the debugging messages and method calls for a JavaBean application.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            BDK Introspection<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Introspection can be defined as the technique of obtaining information about bean properties, events and
            methods<br />
            2. Basically introspection means analysis of bean capabilities.<br />
            3. This is an essential feature of the Java Beans API, because it allows an application builder tool to
            present information about a component to a software designer.<br />
            4. Introspection is the automatic process by which a builder tool finds out which properties, methods, and
            events a bean supports.<br />
            5. Introspection describes how methods, properties, and events are discovered in the beans that you
            write.<br />
            6. This process controls the publishing and discovery of bean operations and properties.<br />
            Without introspection, the Java Beans technology could not operate<br />
            <br />
            **There are two ways in which the developer of a Bean can indicate which of its properties, events, and
            methods should be exposed by an builder tool.<br />
            1. Simple naming conventions are used. These allow the introspection mechanisms to infer information about a
            Bean.<br />
            2. An additional class is provided that explicitly supplies this information.<br />

                According to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many objects
                into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it provides easy
                maintenance.<br />
            </p><br />
            <p><br />
                JavaBean Properties<br />
                A JavaBean property is a named feature that can be accessed by the user of the object. The feature can
                be of any Java data type, containing the classes that you define.<br />
                A JavaBean property may be read, write, read-only, or write-only. JavaBean features are accessed through
                two methods in the JavaBean's implementation class:<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                1. getPropertyName ()<br />
                <br />
                For example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be getFirstName() to read that
                property. This method is called the accessor.<br />
                <br />
                2. setPropertyName ()<br />
                <br />
                For example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be setFirstName() to write that
                property. This method is called the mutator.Every JavaBeans class contains simple property, boolean
                property and indexed properties.<br />
            </p><br />
            <p><br />
                A simple property is one in which a method takes and returns elementary or single value (set of set and
                get methods are known as simple properties of a JavaBeans class.)<br />
                A boolean property is one in which a method takes or return boolean value.<br />
                An indexed property is one in which a method takes or return array of values.<br />

                Topic: 5.21: Bean Info interface
            </h1>
            <p> BeanInfo is an interface implemented by a class that provides explicit information about a Bean. It is
                used to describe one or more feature sets of a Bean, including its properties, methods, and events.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <h2>Feature Descriptors</h2><br />
            <br /><br />
            BeanInfo classes contain descriptors that precisely describe the target Bean's features. The BDK implements
            the following descriptor classes:<br />
            <br /><br />
            <b>FeatureDescriptor </b>is the base class for the other descriptor classes. It declares the aspects common
            to all descriptor types.<br /><br />
            <b>BeanDescriptor</b> describes the target Beans class type and name, and describes the target Beans
            customizer class if it exists<br /><br />
            <b>PropertyDescriptor </b>describes the target Beans properties.<br /><br />
            <b>IndexedPropertyDescriptor</b> is a subclass of PropertyDescriptor, and describes the target Beans indexed
            properties.<br /><br />
            <b>EventSetDescriptor</b> describes the events the target Bean fires.<br /><br />
            <b>MethodDescriptor </b>describes the target Bean's methods.<br /><br />
            <b>ParameterDescriptor </b>describes method parameters.<br />
            <br /><br />
            The BeanInfo interface declares methods that return arrays of the above descriptors.<br /><br />
            <h2>Creating a BeanInfo Class</h2><br /><br />
            <br />
            This section uses the ExplicitButtonBeanInfo demo class to illustrate creating a BeanInfo class. Here are
            the general steps to make a BeanInfo class:<br /><br />
            <br />
            <b>1.Name your BeanInfo class:</b>You must append the string <u>"BeanInfo" </u>to the target class name. If
            the target class name is ExplicitButton, then its associated Bean information class must be named

            Using SimpleBeanInfo saves you from implementing all the BeanInfo methods; you only have to override those

            getMethodDescriptor()) method returns null, low-level reflection is then used for that feature. This means,
            for example, that you can explicitly specify properties, and let low-level reflection discover the methods.
            If you don't override the SimpleBeanInfo default method, which returns null, low-level reflection will be
            used for that feature.<br />

            The BeanBox displays this icon next to the Bean name in the ToolBox. You can expect builder tools to do the

            <b>5.Specify the target Bean class, and, if the Bean has a customizer, specify it also.</b><br /><br />

            for a target Beans BeanInfo class in the target Beans package path. If no BeanInfo is found, then the Bean
            information package search path (maintained by the Introspector) is searched. The default Bean information
            search path is sun.beans.infos. If no BeanInfo class is found, then low-level reflection is used to discover
            a Bean's features. <br />
            <br /><br />
            <h2>Using BeanInfo to Control What Features are Exposed</h2><br />
            <br />
            If you rely on low-level reflection to discover your Bean's features, all those properties, methods, and
            events that conform to the appropriate design patterns will be exposed in a builder tool. This includes any
            features in all base classes. If the BeanBox finds an associated BeanInfo class, then that information is
            used instead, and no more base classes are examined using reflection. In other words, BeanInfo information
            overrides low-level reflection information, and prevents base class examination.<br />
            <br /><br />
            By using a BeanInfo class, you can expose subsets of a particular Bean feature. For example, by not
            returning a method descriptor for a particular method, that method will not be exposed in a builder
            tool.<br /><br />
            <br />
            <h3>When you use a BeanInfo class:<br />
            </h3><br /><br />
            <br />
            Base class features will not be exposed. You can retrieve base class features by using the
            BeanInfo.getAdditionalBeanInfo method.<br />
            <br /><br />
            Properties, events, or methods that have no descriptor will not be exposed. For a particular feature, only
            those items returned in the descriptor array will be exposed. For example, if you return descriptors for all
            your Bean methods except foo, then foo will not be exposed.<br />
            <br />
            Low-level reflection will be used for features with getter methods returning null.<br /><i> For example</i>
            if your BeanInfo class contains this method implementation:<br />
            <br /><br />
            <small>
                <font color="blue">public MethodDescriptor[] getMethodDescriptors() { <br />return null;<br /> }<br />

            </small></font><br />
            <h3>Locating BeanInfo Classes</h3><br />
            <br />
            Before examining a Bean, the Introspector will attempt to find a BeanInfo class associated with the Bean. By
            default, the Introspector takes the target Bean's fully qualified package name, and appends <u>"BeanInfo"
            </u>to form a new class name. <br /><b>For example, </b>if the target Bean is
            sunw.demo.buttons.ExplicitButton, then the Introspector will attempt to locate
            sunw.demo.buttons.ExplicitButtonBeanInfo.<br />
            <br /><br />
            If that fails, then each package in the BeanInfo search path is searched. The BeanInfo search path is
            maintained by Introspector.setBeanInfoSearchPath() and Introspector.getBeanInfoSearchPath().<br />

                BeanInfo is an interface implemented by a class that provides explicit information about a Bean. It is
                used to describe one or more feature sets of a Bean, including its properties, methods, and
                events.<br />
                <br />
                A bean implementor doesn't need to provide a complete set of explicit information. You can pick and
                choose which information you want to provide and the rest will be obtained by automatic analysis using
                low-level reflection of the bean classes' methods and applying standard design patterns.<br />
                <br />
                Creating a BeanInfo Class<br />
                This section uses the ExplicitButtonBeanInfo demo class to illustrate creating a BeanInfo class. Here
                are the general steps to make a BeanInfo class:<br />
                <br />
                1.Name your BeanInfo class: You must append the string "BeanInfo" to the target class name. If the
                target class name is ExplicitButton, then its associated Bean information class must be named
                ExplicitButtonBeanInfo<br />
                <br />
                2.Subclass SimpleBeanInfo: This is a convenience class that implements BeanInfo methods to return null,
                or an equivalent no-op value.<br />
                public class ExplicitButtonBeanInfo extends SimpleBeanInfo {<br />
                Using SimpleBeanInfo saves you from implementing all the BeanInfo methods; you only have to override
                those methods you need.<br />
                <br />
                3.Override the appropriate methods to return the properties, methods, or events that you want
                exposed:ExplicitButtonBeanInfo overrides the getPropertyDescriptors() method to return four
                properties:<br />
                public PropertyDescriptor[] getPropertyDescriptors() {<br />
                try { <br />
                PropertyDescriptor background =<br />
                new PropertyDescriptor("background", beanClass);<br />
                PropertyDescriptor foreground =<br />
                new PropertyDescriptor("foreground", beanClass);<br />
                PropertyDescriptor font =<br />
                new PropertyDescriptor("font", beanClass);<br />
                PropertyDescriptor label =<br />
                new PropertyDescriptor("label", beanClass);<br />
                <br />
                background.setBound(true);<br />
                foreground.setBound(true);<br />
                font.setBound(true);<br />
                label.setBound(true);<br />
                <br />
                PropertyDescriptor rv[] =<br />
                {background, foreground, font, label};<br />
                return rv;<br />
                } catch (IntrospectionException e) {<br />
                throw new Error(e.toString());<br />
                }<br />
                } <br />
                There are two important things to note here:<br />
                <br />
                If you leave a descriptor out, that property, event or method will not be exposed. In other words, you
                can selectively expose properties, events, or methods by leaving out those you don't want exposed.<br />
                <br />
                If a feature's getter (for example, getMethodDescriptor()) method returns null, low-level reflection is
                then used for that feature. This means, for example, that you can explicitly specify properties, and let
                low-level reflection discover the methods. If you don't override the SimpleBeanInfo default method,
                which returns null, low-level reflection will be used for that feature.<br />
                <br />
                4.Optionally associate an icon with the target Bean:<br />
                <br />
                public java.awt.Image getIcon(int iconKind) {<br />
                if (iconKind == BeanInfo.ICON_MONO_16x16 ||<br />
                iconKind == BeanInfo.ICON_COLOR_16x16 )<br />
                {<br />
                java.awt.Image img = loadImage("ExplicitButtonIcon16.gif");<br />
                return img;<br />
                }<br />
                if (iconKind == BeanInfo.ICON_MONO_32x32 ||<br />
                iconKind == BeanInfo.ICON_COLOR_32x32 )<br />
                {<br />
                java.awt.Image img = loadImage("ExplicitButtonIcon32.gif");<br />
                return img;<br />
                }<br />
                return null;<br />
                }<br />
                The BeanBox displays this icon next to the Bean name in the ToolBox. You can expect builder tools to do
                the same.<br />
                <br />
                5.Specify the target Bean class, and, if the Bean has a customizer, specify it also:<br />
                <br />
                public BeanDescriptor getBeanDescriptor() {<br />
                return new BeanDescriptor(beanClass, customizerClass);<br />
                }<br />
                ...<br />
                private final static Class beanClass = ExplicitButton.class;<br />
                private final static Class customizerClass = OurButtonCustomizer.class;<br />
                Keep the BeanInfo class in the same directory as its target class. The BeanBox first searches for a
                target Bean's BeanInfo class in the target Bean's package path. If no BeanInfo is found, then the Bean
                information package search path (maintained by the Introspector) is searched. The default Bean
                information search path is sun.beans.infos. If no BeanInfo class is found, then low-level reflection is
                used to discover a Bean's features.<br />
                <br />
                Feature Descriptors:<br />
                <br />
                BeanInfo classes contain descriptors that precisely describe the target Bean's features. The BDK
                implements the following descriptor classes:<br />
                <br />
                1.FeatureDescriptor is the base class for the other descriptor classes. It declares the aspects common
                to all descriptor types.<br />
                2.BeanDescriptor describes the target Bean's class type and name, and describes the target Bean's
                customizer class if it exists.<br />
                3.PropertyDescriptor describes the target Bean's properties.<br />
                4.IndexedPropertyDescriptor is a subclass of PropertyDescriptor, and describes the target Bean's indexed
                properties.<br />
                5.EventSetDescriptor describes the events the target Bean fires.<br />
                6.MethodDescriptor describes the target Bean's methods.<br />
                7.ParameterDescriptor describes method parameters.<br />
                <br />
                "The BeanInfo interface declares methods that return arrays of the above descriptors."<br />
                <br />
                Using BeanInfo to Control What Features are Exposed:<br />
                <br />
                If you rely on low-level reflection to discover your Bean's features, all those properties, methods, and
                events that conform to the appropriate design patterns will be exposed in a builder tool. This includes
                any features in all base classes. If the BeanBox finds an associated BeanInfo class, then that
                information is used instead, and no more base classes are examined using reflection. In other words,
                BeanInfo information overrides low-level reflection information, and prevents base class
                examination.<br />
                <br />
                By using a BeanInfo class, you can expose subsets of a particular Bean feature. For example, by not
                returning a method descriptor for a particular method, that method will not be exposed in a builder
                tool.<br />
                <br />
                When you use a BeanInfo class:<br />
                <br />
                Base class features will not be exposed. You can retrieve base class features by using the
                BeanInfo.getAdditionalBeanInfo method.<br />
                <br />
                Properties, events, or methods that have no descriptor will not be exposed. For a particular feature,
                only those items returned in the descriptor array will be exposed.<br />
                <br />
                For example, if you return descriptors for all your Bean methods except foo, then foo will not be
                exposed.<br />
                <br />
                Low-level reflection will be used for features with getter methods returning null. For example if your
                BeanInfo class contains this method implementation:<br />
                <br />
                public MethodDescriptor[] getMethodDescriptors() {<br />
                return null;<br />
                }<br />
                <br />
                Then low-level reflection will be used to discover your Bean's public methods.<br />
                <br />
                Locating BeanInfo Classes:<br />
                <br />
                Before examining a Bean, the Introspector will attempt to find a BeanInfo class associated with the
                Bean. By default, the Introspector takes the target Bean's fully qualified package name, and appends
                "BeanInfo" to form a new class name. For example, if the target Bean is
                sunw.demo.buttons.ExplicitButton, then the Introspector will attempt to locate
                sunw.demo.buttons.ExplicitButtonBeanInfo.<br />
                <br />
                If that fails, then each package in the BeanInfo search path is searched. The BeanInfo search path is
                maintained by Introspector.setBeanInfoSearchPath() and Introspector.getBeanInfoSearchPath().<br />

            <p><br />
                The JavaBeans specification provides for user-defined customizers, through which you can define a higher
                level of customization for bean properties than is available with property editors.<br />
            </p><br />
            <p><br />
                When you use a bean Customizer, you have complete control over how to configure or edit a bean. A
                Customizer is an application that specifically targets a bean's customization. Sometimes properties are
                insufficient for representing a bean's configurable attributes. Customizers are used where sophisticated
                instructions would be needed to change a bean, and where property editors are too primitive to achieve
                bean customization.<br />
            </p><br />
            <p><br />
                All customizers must:<br />

                Extend java.awt.Component or one of its subclasses.<br />
                Implement the java.beans.Customizer interface This means implementing methods to register
                PropertyChangeListener objects, and firing property change events at those listeners when a change to
                the target bean has occurred.<br />

            </h1>
            JavaBean exports properties, events and methods. The beanbox tool determines the properties,<br />
            events and methods a bean supports by using an "introspection" mechanism. The FeatureDescriptor class<br />
            (which is the base class for MethodDescriptor and PropertyDescriptor) provides this introspection<br />
            information.<br />
            Below is a brief discussion on the these topics.<br />
            <br />
            PROPERTIES<br />
            <br />
            Bean properties are attributes of the bean's internal state. These associated pieces can be queried<br />
            or can be set via appropriate methods exported by the bean. In addition to basic properties,<br />
            the property itself may be indexed, bound or constrained.<br />
            <br />
            An indexed property has an array value whereas methods allow each element or the entire array to be
            set..<br />
            A bound property provides notification service when a property changes. In general, a
            PropertyChangeListener<br />
            event listener interface reports the event. A constrained property not only notifies registered listeners,
            but it<br />
            also allows for input. Another bean may veto the change deeming it invalid; thus the property change
            cannot<br />
            commence until all interested beans concur.<br />
            <br />
            Interfaces for property changes:<br />
            <br />
            public interface java.beans.PropertyChangeListener extends java.util.EventListener<br />
            public PropertyChangeEvent (Object source, String propertyName, Object oldValue, Object newValue);<br />
            <br />
            public Object getNewValue();<br />
            public Object getOldValue();<br />
            public Object getPropagationId();<br />
            public String getPropertyName();<br />
            public void setPropagationId(Object propagationId);<br />
            <br />
            Public PropertyVetoException(String mess, Property ChangeEvent evt);<br />
            <br />
            EVENTS::<br />
            <br />
            Events are a core feature of the JavaBeans. This is well suited for event driven programming. JavaBean
            event<br />
            modeling is based on the AWT components. When an event is dispatched to the appropriate listener,<br />
            it passes through the processEvent() method. In general, this method checks the class of the event and<br />
            sends it to the class specific method. For example, if a mouse event occured, the event is passed to
            either<br />
            processMouseEvent() or<br />
            processMouseMotionEvent().<br />
            <br />
            METHODS::<br />
            <br />
            JavaBean methods do not entail any special meaning. They are simply any external methods supported by a
            bean.<br />

                Topic: 5.25: EJB
            </h1>
            <br />
            Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) is one of the several Java APIs for standard manufacture of enterprise software.
            EJB is a server-side software element that summarizes business logic of an application. Enterprise Java
            Beans web repository yields a runtime domain for web related software elements including computer
            reliability, Java Servlet Lifecycle (JSL) management, transaction procedure and other web services. The EJB
            enumeration is a subset of the Java EE enumeration.<br />
            <br />
            The EJB enumeration was originally developed by IBM in 1997 and later adopted by Sun Microsystems in 1999
            and enhanced under the Java Community Process.<br />
            <br />
            The EJB enumeration aims to provide a standard way to implement the server-side business software typically
            found in enterprise applications. Such machine code addresses the same types of problems, and solutions to
            these problems are often repeatedly re-implemented by programmers. Enterprise Java Beans is assumed to
            manage such common concerns as endurance, transactional probity and security in a standard way that leavs
            programmers free to focus on the particular parts of the enterprise software at hand.<br />
            <br />
            To run EJB application we need an application server (EJB Container) such as Jboss, Glassfish, Weblogic,
            Websphere etc. It performs:<br />
            <br />
            1. Life cycle management<br />
            2. Security<br />
            3. Transaction management<br />
            4. Object pooling<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Types of Enterprise Java Beans<br />
            <br />
            There are three types of EJB:<br />
            1. Session Bean: Session bean contains business logic that can be invoked by local, remote or webservice
            client. There are two types of session beans: (i) Stateful session bean and (ii) Stateless session
            bean.<br />
            <br />
            (i) Stateful Session bean :<br />
            Stateful session bean performs business task with the help of a state. Stateful session bean can be used to
            access various method calls by storing the information in an instance variable. Some of the applications
            require information to be stored across separate method calls. In a shopping site, the items chosen by a
            customer must be stored as data is an example of stateful session bean.<br />
            (ii) Stateless Session bean :<br />
            Stateless session bean implement business logic without having a persistent storage mechanism, such as a
            state or database and can used shared data. Stateless session bean can be used in situations where
            information is not required to used across call methods.<br />
            2. Message Driven Bean: Like Session Bean, it contains the business logic but it is invoked by passing
            message.<br />
            3. Entity Bean: It summarizes the state that can be remained in the database. It is deprecated. Now, it is
            replaced with JPA (Java Persistent API). There are two types of entity bean:<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            (i) Bean Managed Persistence :<br />
            In a bean managed persistence type of entity bean, the programmer has to write the code for database calls.
            It persists across multiple sessions and multiple clients.<br />
            (ii) Container Managed Persistence :<br />
            Container managed persistence are enterprise bean that persists across database. In container managed
            persistence the container take care of database calls.<br />
            When to use Enterprise Java Beans<br />
            <br />
            1.Application needs Remote Access. In other words, it is distributed.<br />
            2.Application needs to be scalable. EJB applications supports load balancing, clustering and
            fail-over.<br />
            3.Application needs encapsulated business logic. EJB application is differentiated from demonstration and
            persistent layer.<br />
            <br />
            Advantages of Enterprise Java Beans:<br />
            ____________________________________<br />
            <br />
            1. EJB repository yields system-level services to enterprise beans, the bean developer can focus on solving
            business problems. Rather than the bean developer, the EJB repository is responsible for system-level
            services such as transaction management and security authorization.<br />
            2. The beans rather than the clients contain the application’s business logic, the client developer can
            focus on the presentation of the client. The client developer does not have to code the pattern that execute
            business rules or access databases. Due to this the clients are thinner which is a benefit that is
            particularly important for clients that run on small devices.<br />
            3. Enterprise Java Beans are portable elements, the application assembler can build new applications from
            the beans that already exists.<br />
            <br />
            Disadvantages of Enterprise Java Beans:<br />
            ________________________________<br />
            <br />
            1. Requires application server<br />
            2. Requires only java client. For other language client, you need to go for webservice.<br />
            3. Complex to understand and develop EJB applications.<br />

                Topic: 5.26: Introduction to Struts Framework
            </h1>
            Introduction:<br />
            <br />
            Web portal has become one of the most important and powerful sources of information, services and
            transactions processes across all over the world. To maximize the potential and the accessible of the
            information on a multi device and multilingual web pages, it has become a major factor in developing aweb
            based application. The key factors for developing web based applications to be accessible by multidevice and
            multilingual is to separate the presentation and data layer. This will promote the capabilityand reusability
            of the web applications.<br />
            Briefly, Struts provides a framework using standard Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)components
            such as JavaServer Pages (JSPs), servlets, and JavaBeans for building Model 2, a variantof the model view
            controller (MVC) application design paradigm applications. Therefore the benefitsof the separation of
            presentation and data layer for a large web applications is different groups of people can handle their own
            project. For examples, page designers can concentrate on the interface partwhile the web programmer will
            concentrate on the core programming layer or the business rule.<br />
            <br />
            Model/Resource component:<br />
            <br />
            This is a component where all data access object involved (DAO) in listing the invoices. In non-strutsJSP,
            we do mixed the access to database statement in jsp files. Example below explained the aboveissue. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <jsp:useBean id="listinv" class="invoice”  scope=" session" /> <br />
            listinv.connect(); <br />
            Vector invoice= listinv.getVectorRow();<br />
            The line above tells us that connection to the database has been made in order to access the data. Thedata
            retrieved is put in a list of Vector called invoice.But in struts, the JSP do not need to get the
            connection. This is accessed by subclasses of Struts’ Action object .Action subclasses interact with the
            Model via Action’s interfaces and used DAO to pass andretrieve data. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Controller:<br />
            It consists of Application Resources Properties that used specially to internationalizing a page. This
            isimportant especially for producing content specific to a language, locale or region. We could havemany
            Application Resources Properties files for different languages. Besides, it also consists of
            struts-config.xml. This file has 2 elements that commonly used which is form-beans and Action
            mapping.Form-beans is a set of form-bean elements that describe the form beans that this application used
            whileAction mapping is a set of action elements describing a request-to-action mapping. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <form-beans> <br />
                <form-bean name="ListInvoiceForm" type="eproc.ordermgt.invoice.presentation.ListInvoiceForm" /> <br />
            </form-beans> <br />
            <action-mappings> <br />
                <action name="ListInvoiceForm" parameter="theAction path="/BM/eproc/ordermgt/invoice/listInvoice" <br />
                type="eproc.ordermgt.invoice.presentation.ListInvoiceAction" <br />
                input="/BM/eproc/ordermgt/invoice/listInvoice.jsp" scope="request" <br />
                <forward name="listBuyerInvoice" path="/BM/eproc/ordermgt/invoice/listBuyerInvoice.jsp"
                    redirect="false" /> <br />
                </action>
                </action-mappings<br />
                <br />
                Advantages:<br />
                Struts offers number of significant advantages. By using struts, our program becomes modularprogramming
                that divides the program into separate layers (Model, View, Controller). It makes theactual program
                shorter, easier to read and to understand. <br />
                In the other hand, the program being morestructured.Besides that, struts helps reduce bugs, easier and
                simpler to figure programs and also helps developermanages and debugs the program quickly. Developer
                only have to fix specific layer that has errorwithout touching other layers.The programs also more
                reusability. Others developers no need to create the same object orcomponents. They can reuse it by call
                the object. Reusing components will reduce overhead and saveresources.<br />
                In addition it reduce both construction time and maintenance costs.Using MVC architecture in Struts
                framework allow developers improve the performance. Struts isrobust architecture and can be used for the
                development of application of any size. Struts frameworkmakes it much easier to design scalable,
                reliable Web applications with Java.<br />
